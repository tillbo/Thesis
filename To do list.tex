To do

*add percentage reductions and marginal effects to Chapter 5. Makes it more consistent with rest of thesis.
*also use linear iv
*maybe use truncated instead of untruncated results as main results
*maybe add migration status to set of covariates as ample literature shows that migrants are worse off
*threeparttable in chapter 3 to have nicer looking notes below tables
*what is age at diagnosis for those in informal labour market in Mexico. . The older they are the more this would suggest that due to lack of insurance they get diagnosed really late and therefore bear larger burden. Maybe have exploratory analysis of this in chapter 4?
*correct statement in Cha 3 that women are less affected. this is not true if we look at relative changes instead of absolute


**FUTURE RESEARCH
*Are rural women more affected by diabetes (or migrating women)?
