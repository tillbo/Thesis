      \field{labeltitle}{{Economic Burden of Diabetes and Hypertension in CARICOM States}}
      \field{abstract}{This paper provides estimates of the economic burden of diabetes and hypertension for 2001 in four Caribbean countries using the cost of illness approach. Our findings show that hypertension posed a greater burden than diabetes in the Bahamas, Barbados, and Jamaica while diabetes posed a greater burden in Trinidad and Tobago when absolute costs are considered. When costs are calculated on a per person basis, diabetes represented a higher economic burden across the four countries. Taken together, the burden of these two diseases ranged between a low of 1.36{\%} of GDP for the Bahamas to a high of 8{\%} of GDP for Trinidad and Tobago. These figures are compelling enough to stimulate the Caribbean heads of government to decide to take collective action to address the modifiable risk factors that contribute to the high prevalence of the common NCDs in the region.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost-of-illness studies : a review of current methods.}}
      \field{abstract}{The number of cost-of-illness (COI) studies has expanded considerably over time. One outcome of this growth is that the reported COI estimates are inconsistent across studies, thereby raising concerns over the validity of the estimates and methods. Several factors have been identified in the literature as reasons for the observed variation in COI estimates. To date, the variation in the methods used to calculate costs has not been examined in great detail even though the variations in methods are a major driver of variation in COI estimates. The objective of this review was to document the variation in the methodologies employed in COI studies and to highlight the benefits and limitations of these methods. The review of COI studies was implemented following a four-step procedure: (i) a structured literature search of MEDLINE, JSTOR and EconLit; (ii) a review of abstracts using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria; (iii) a full-text review using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria; and (iv) classification of articles according to the methods used to calculate costs. This review identified four COI estimation methods (Sum{\_}All Medical, Sum{\_}Diagnosis Specific, Matched Control and Regression) that were used in categorising articles. Also, six components of direct medical costs and five components of indirect/non-medical costs were identified and used in categorising articles.365 full-length articles were reflected in the current review following the structured literature search. The top five cost components were emergency room/inpatient hospital costs, outpatient physician costs, drug costs, productivity losses and laboratory costs. The dominant method, Sum{\_}Diagnosis Specific, was a total costing approach that restricted the summation of medical expenditures to those related to a diagnosis of the disease of interest. There was considerable variation in the methods used within disease subcategories. In several disease subcategories (e.g. asthma, dementia, diabetes mellitus), all four estimation methods were represented, and in other cases (e.g. HIV/AIDS, obesity, stroke, urinary incontinence, schizophrenia), three of the four estimation methods were represented. There was also evidence to suggest that the strengths and weaknesses of each method were considered when applying a method to a specific illness. Comparisons and assessments of COI estimates should consider the method used to estimate costs both as an important source of variation in the reported COI estimates and as a marker of the reliability of the COI estimate.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Unemployment and retirement and ill-health: a cross-sectional analysis across European countries}}
      \field{abstract}{Objective To determine the associations between different measures of health and labor market position across ten European countries. Methods We studied 11,462 participants of the Survey on Health and Ageing in Europe (SHARE) who were 50-64years old. Logistic regression was used to calculate the associations between health and other determinants and being retired, unemployed, or a homemaker. Results A large variation across European countries was observed for the proportion of persons 50-65years with paid employment, varying among men from 42{\%} in Austria to 75{\%} in Sweden and among women from 22{\%} in Italy to 69{\%} in Sweden. Among employed workers 18{\%} reported a poor health, whereas this proportion was 37{\%} in retirees, 39{\%} in unemployed persons, and 35{\%} in homemakers. A perceived poor health was strongly associated with non-participating in labor force in most European countries. A lower education, being single, physical inactivity and a high body mass index were associated with withdrawal from the labor force. Long-term illnesses such as depression, stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and musculoskeletal disease were significantly more common among those persons not having paid employment. Conclusion In many European countries a poor health, chronic diseases, and lifestyle factors were associated with being out of the labor market. The results of this study suggest that in social policies to encourage employment among older persons the role of ill-health and its influencing factors needs to be incorporated.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Health care costs and financial consequences of epidemiological changes in chronic diseases in Latin America: evidence from Mexico}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To determine the costs of health services and the financial consequences of changes in the epidemiological profile of chronic diseases in Latin America. STUDY DESIGN We conducted longitudinal analyses of costs and of the economic impact of the epidemiological transition in healthcare services for diabetes and hypertension in the Mexican health system. The study population included both the insured and uninsured populations. METHODS The cost-evaluation method was based on the instrumentation and consensus techniques. To estimate the epidemiological changes and financial consequences for 2004-2006, six models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique, using confidence intervals of 95{\%} and the Box-Pierce test. FINDINGS Costs ranged from US{\$}613 to US{\$}887 for diabetes, and from US{\$}485 to US{\$}622 for hypertension. Regarding epidemiological changes for 2004 compared with 2006, an increase is expected in both cases, although results predict a greater increase for diabetes, 10-15{\%} in all three institutions (P{\textless}0.05). Comparing the financial consequences of health services required by insured and uninsured populations, the greater increase (17{\%}) will be for the insured population (P{\textless}0.05). The financial requirements for both diseases will amount to 9.5{\%} of the total budget for the uninsured population and 13.5{\%} for the insured population. CONCLUSIONS If the risk factors and the different healthcare models remain as they are at present, the economic impact of expected epidemiological changes on the social security system will be particularly strong. Another relevant financial factor is the appearance of internal competition in the use and allocation of financial resources among the main providers in the health services; this factor becomes even more complicated within each provider. In effect, within each institution, hypertension and diabetes programmes must compete for resources with other programmes for chronic and infectious diseases.}

      \field{abstract}{The main objective was to identify economic burden from epidemiological changes and expected demand for health care services for diabetes in M{\'{e}}xico. The cost evaluation method to estimate direct and indirect costs was based on instrumentation and consensus techniques. To estimate the epidemiological changes for 2009-2011, three probabilistic models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique. Comparing the economic impact in 2009 versus 2011 (p{\textless} 0.05), there is a 33{\%} increase in financial requirements. The total amount for diabetes in 2010 (US dollars) will be {\$}778,427,475. It includes {\$}343,226,541 in direct costs and {\$}435,200,934 in indirect costs. The total direct costs expected are: {\$}40,787,547 for the Ministry of Health (SSA), serving to uninsured population; {\$}113,664,454 for insured population (Mexican Institute for Social Security-IMSS-, and Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers-ISSSTE-); {\$}178,477,754 to users; and {\$}10,296,786 to Private Health Insurance (PHI). Conclusions: If the risk factors and the different health care models remain as they are currently in the institutions analyzed, the financial consequences would be of major impact for the pockets of the users, following in order of importance, social security institutions and finally Ministry of Health. Allocate more resources to promotion and prevention of diabetes will decrease the cost increase by decreasing the demand for treatment of complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Economic consequences of epidemiological changes in diabetes in middle-income countries: The Mexican case}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE - To identify the costs and economic consequences of expected changes in the demand for health care services for type 2 diabetes in the three main public institutions of the Mexican health care system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The cost evaluation method to estimate direct and indirect costs was based on instrumentation and consensus techniques. To estimate the costs and epidemiological changes for 2003-2005, three probabilistic models were constructed according to the Box-Jenkins technique. RESULTS - Comparing the economic impact in 2003 versus 2005 (P {\textless} 0.05), there is a 26{\%} increase in financial requirements. The total amount for diabetes in 2005 (in U.S. dollars) will be {\$}317,631,206, including {\$}140,410,816 in direct costs and {\$}177,220,390 in indirect costs. The total direct costs, representing financial requirements to provide health care for expected cases of type 2 diabetes and its main complications in the three main public institutions in Mexico, up to 2005, will be {\$}37,079,587 for the Ministry of Health (or Secretaria de Salud [SSA], serving the uninsured population) and {\$}103,331,235 for the Mexican Social Security Institute, or Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers, or Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), both of which serve the insured population. CONCLUSIONS - Our data suggest that changes in the demand for health care services for patients with diabetes will continue with an increasing trend, mainly in the insured population. In economic terms, the results of direct and indirect costs are one of the main challenges to be solved to decrease the economic burden that diabetes represents for the population, the health care institutions, and for society as a whole.}

      \field{abstract}{An observational descriptive study was carried out of the healthcare resources consumed during 1 year by a sample of patients with type II diabetes of a healthcare area in southern Spain. A total of 517 patients with a mean duration of disease of 9.7+/-8 years were assessed. A total annual health cost of 4,278 euro/patient was calculated (direct 2,504 euro; indirect 1,774 euro). Multiple regression analysis showed an independent association between total costs and obesity, male sex, number of hospitalizations related to diabetes, permanent disability, macrovascular complications, and both micro- and macrovascular complications. Our findings confirm both the high economic cost associated with type II diabetes and the direct relationship between the costs of the disease and the presence of obesity, male sex, hospitalizations related to diabetes, permanent disability and chronic complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The cost of diabetes in Latin America and the Caribbean}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To measure the economic burden associated with diabetes mellitus in Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS Prevalence estimates of diabetes for the year 2000 were used to calculated direct and indirect costs of diabetes mellitus. Direct costs included costs due to drugs, hospitalizations, consultations and management of complications. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs and included calculations of forgone earnings due to premature mortality and disability attributed to diabetes mellitus. Mortality and disability attributed to causes other than diabetes were subtracted from estimates to consider only the excess burden due to diabetes. A 3{\%} discount rate was used to convert future earnings to current value. FINDINGS The annual number of deaths in 2000 caused by diabetes mellitus was estimated at 339,035. This represented a loss of 757,096 discounted years of productive life among persons younger than 65 years ({\textgreater} billion US dollars). Permanent disability caused a loss of 12,699,087 years and over 50 billion US dollars, and temporary disability caused a loss of 136,701 years in the working population and over 763 million US dollars. Costs associated with insulin and oral medications were 4720 million US dollars, hospitalizations 1012 million US dollars, consultations 2508 million US dollars and care for complications 2,480 million US dollars. The total annual cost associated with diabetes was estimated as 65,216 million US dollars (direct 10,721 US dollars; indirect 54,496 US dollars). CONCLUSION Despite limitations of the data, diabetes imposes a high economic burden to individuals and society in all countries and to Latin American and the Caribbean as whole.}

      \field{abstract}{Epidemiological studies indicate that minority populations in the US - including African Americans, Native Americans and Mexican Americans - are particularly at risk for diabetes and that their complications are more frequent and severe. Using microdata from a 1994-1999 population based study of middle aged and older Mexican Americans in the Southwest, this study analyzes the impact of diabetes on the employment and earnings outcomes of adults 45 years of age and older. The empirical results from estimating maximum likelihood employment and earnings models suggest that diabetes leads to lower productivity and earnings for women but has no statistically significant impact on their employment probability. In the case of men, however, diabetes leads to a lower employment propensity but has no effect on earnings. Thus, the problems associated with this condition could lead to potential future financial difficulties particularly for high-risk populations in their later years.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The social and economic cost of diabetes mellitus}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic impact in terms of the direct costs (health care costs) and the indirect costs (effects on production caused by mortality and morbidity) of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Canary Islands (Spain) during 1998. DESIGN: The approach used was to study the cost of the disease through looking only at people in the productive sphere (human capital). Direct and indirect costs were calculated by using costs of prevalence, i.e. the costs caused during 1998. SETTING: Direct costs were broken down into hospital care, primary care, out-patient consultations, drugs and further tests; indirect costs, into premature mortality and time off work. Measurements and main results. The total cost of DM amounted to 6468.76 million pesetas (38.88 millio ), or the equivalent of 126 168 pesetas (758.28 ) a year for each known diabetic patient. Total direct cost of DM was 4011.51 million pesetas (24.11 million ), which amounts to 2.13{\%} of health expenditure in the Canaries; or the equivalent of 78 240 pesetas (470.23 ) a year for each known diabetic patient. Direct cost of health care was 62{\%} of the total cost. Total indirect cost was 2457.25 million pesetas (14.77 million ), 38{\%} of the total cost. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the conservatism of the approach, in that the study omitted costs linked to pain and suffering, permanent disability or home care by family members, the high social and economic cost of DM patients calls for cost-effectiveness studies that would permit a more transparent debate on this question.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{[Assessment of diabetes mellitus type 2 treatment costs in the Republic of Serbia]}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND/AIM High morbidity and mortality rates, chronic course of disease and numerous clinical complications, make diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 bear significant financial burden for healthcare system of Serbia. The aim of this study was to compare true disease-related expenses measured in the random sample of patients originating from the Central Serbia in 2007 and national estimate of total expenses based on available evidence on antidiabetic drugs and insulins acquisition costs in the same fiscal year. METHODS The study design was prevalence-based, bottom-up cost of illness analysis. It was implemented on a randomized sample of 99 adults with confirmed diagnosis of DM type 2. During 2007 all direct (drug acquisition, medical services, medical devices usage) and indirect costs associated with their primary disease (premature death, impaired working ability, early retirement, absentism), were taken into account. Other approach was to calculate average national rate of antidiabetic drugs and insulin utilization and sales at the domestic market during the mentioned period of time. Taking into consideration available estimate from the Institute of Public Health of Serbia of 475,000 people with this disease at the national level, we were able to compare these data. Assuming that our sample was enough representative and that the structure of costs was approximately similar at the local and national level, we were able to calculate an estimate of total cost of the disease. All costs were expressed in Serbian official currency, dinar (CSD). RESULTS Values of costs measured per patient in our sample in a given year were for drug acquisition 20,352.45 CSD, medical services 24,338.26 CSD, medical devices 3174.46 CSD and loss of productivity and absentism 5547.78 CSD. There were 2 cases of early retirement due to the disease and no cases of dialysis treatment or premature death. A total number of sickness absence days of employed patients, was 1025 and a total number of hospital treatment days was 360. A total amount of all costs was 53,412.96 CSD per patient per year. According to the National Medicines and Medical Devices Agency an overall value of oral antidiabetic drug sales for 2007 per patient was 1835.32 CSD and for insulins and analogs 2948.18 CSD. CONCLUSION Comparing true size of national financial burden of DM type 2 with experiences of other authors, we can see that it is comparable with European OECD average. But, if the structure of expenses is taken into account, Serbia is more similar tothose countries reported in the Third World economies. Ourlocal findings on a sample of diabetic population show that real patient expenses were even 2.28 times higher than those estimated at the national level.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Lifetime medical costs for women: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stress urinary incontinence}}
      \field{abstract}{Purpose. To estimate the absolute and relative lifetime medical costs of treating women with cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, or stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Methods. Women under 65 years, treated for CVD, diabetes, or SUI, were identified using administrative medical claims data from a large employer (n {\textgreater}100,000). A case-control methodology was used to estimate the annual medical costs of these women. Based on these estimates and published government statistics, annual costs for women 65 years and older were calculated. An incidence-based methodology with steady-state assumptions was used to project to lifetime medical costs. Cost estimates are incremental, measured as the difference between costs of patients and their demographically similar controls without the condition. They therefore represent the additional costs of treating patients with the condition, beyond the average, baseline costs incurred by controls without the condition. Findings. The incremental lifetime medical cost of treating a woman (in 2002 dollars) with CVD is {\$}423,000, with diabetes is {\$}233,000, and with SUI is {\$}58,000. Including the baseline medical costs of the control, the total lifetime medical costs (i.e., sum of incremental and baseline lifetime medical costs) of treating a woman with CVD are 3.4 times greater than the costs of a woman without CVD. Similarly, a woman with diabetes has total costs on average, 2.5 times greater than the costs of her control, whereas a woman with SUI has total lifetime medical costs 1.8 times greater than the costs of a similar woman without SUI. Conclusions. These substantial cost estimates suggest the need for further gender-specific research and policies addressing the long-term implications of health care financing, treatment, and preventive care.}

      \field{abstract}{The purpose of this study was to analyse whether the nationwide application of the national Serbian guideline for diabetes mellitus (NSGDM) would save a relevant amount of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and/or reduce the medical cost of treating diabetic patients in Serbia, as compared to the present situation. Disability-adjusted life years were calculated for Serbia and the cost-effectiveness was analysed in eight population groups under ideal and present conditions; prevalent and incident cases were each split up for patients with blood glucose that was well controlled and that was uncontrolled. Under ideal conditions, i.e., according to the NSGDM, 8,031 DALYs could be saved with a potential cost reduction at the same time of approximately 19 million Euros. The implementation of the NSGDM in clinical practice bears a great potential to save lives and reduce years lived with lowered quality of life, but in addition it may reduce costs by about a quarter.}

      \field{abstract}{Aim The aim of this study was to estimate healthcare cost and productivity losses as a result of diabetes and diabetes-related chronic complications in Sweden in 1987 and 2005. Research design and methods Published estimates on relative risks and Swedish age-specific diabetes-prevalence rates were used to calculate the proportions of diabetes-related chronic complications that are attributable to diabetes. These attributable risks were applied to cost estimates for diabetes-related chronic complications based on data from Swedish population registers. Results The estimated total costs for Sweden in 1987 and 2005 were EUR439m and EUR920m, respectively. The increase of 110{\%} was as a result of a 69{\%} increase in the estimated prevalence from 150 000 (1.8{\%} of the population) to 254 000 (2.8{\%}) and of an increase in the estimated annual cost per person diagnosed with diabetes by 24{\%}. Healthcare accounted for 45{\%} of the estimated cost in 1987 and for 37{\%} in 2005. The estimated diabetes-related healthcare cost accounted for approximately 1.0{\%} of total healthcare cost in Sweden in 1987 and for 1.4{\%} in 2005. Diabetes per se accounted for 57{\%} of the healthcare cost in 1987 and for 50{\%} in 2005. The most important chronic complication was cardiovascular disease. Conclusions The cost of diabetes is substantial and increasing even in a fairly low-prevalence country such as Sweden. Measures to curb the increase in prevalence and to improve individual control of his or her diabetes seem to be the most important challenges. 2009 Diabetes UK.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Estimation of the direct cost of diabetes in the Arab region}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Diabetes needs costly prolonged treatment and care. Its burden affects the whole society. Six of the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes are in the Middle East. Following the studies carried out in Latin America and the Caribbean countries, and in the WHO African region, an estimation of the direct cost of diabetes in the Arab region is proposed. METHOD: Arab countries were classified into three income groups. The prevalence of diabetes was estimated in each country. The direct cost of diabetes included the cost of insulin, oral drugs, reagent strips, urine strips, lancets, glucose meters, laboratory tests, outpatient consultation and hospitalization. To overcome the problem of disparity in prices, three scenarios were used (Low, Medium and High price). RESULTS: The annual average per capita direct cost of diabetes is estimated in US dollars at USD 351, USD 529 and USD 860 according to the low, medium and high cost scenarios, respectively. The cost varies also according to the income group. The annual total direct cost of diabetes in the 21 countries of the Arab world is estimated to be between USD 9 billion and USD 22 billion. The annual average per capita direct cost of diabetes in the Arab region is 1.4 to 3.5 times higher than the average per capita health expenditure of the region (USD 250). The direct cost of diabetes in the third income group is 4.8 to 11.4 higher than the average per capita health expenditure of the group (USD 66.5) whereas, in the first group, the ratio is 0.4 to 1.14. Although indirect cost is not considered in this paper, it is stressed that diabetes also incurs indirect costs due to loss of productivity caused by premature death and disability, and intangible and non-quantifiable costs. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the direct cost of diabetes is high compared to health expenditure in Arab countries. A sincere call is sent to health decision makers to give more importance to sensitisation, early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The direct medical cost of type 2 diabetes}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To describe the direct medical costs associated with type 2 diabetes, as well as its treatments, complications, and comorbidities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied a random sample of 1,364 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were members of a Michigan health maintenance organization. Demographic characteristics, duration of diabetes, diabetes treatments, glycemic control, complications, and comorbidities were assessed by surveys and medical chart reviews. Annual resource utilization and costs were assessed using health insurance claims. The log-transformed annual direct medical costs were fitted by multiple linear regression to indicator variables for demographics, treatments, glycemic control, complications, and comorbidities. RESULTS The median annual direct medical costs for subjects with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes, BMI 30 kg/m(2), and no microvascular, neuropathic, or cardiovascular complications were 1,700 dollars for white men and 2,100 dollars for white women. A 10-kg/m(2) increase in BMI, treatment with oral antidiabetic or antihypertensive agents, diabetic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease were each associated with 10-30{\%} increases in cost. Insulin treatment, angina, and MI were each associated with 60-90{\%} increases in cost. Dialysis was associated with an 11-fold increase in cost. CONCLUSIONS Insulin treatment and diabetes complications have a substantial impact on the direct medical costs of type 2 diabetes. The estimates presented in this model may be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of interventions for type 2 diabetes.}

      \field{abstract}{Diabetes has been shown to have a detrimental impact on employment and labor market productivity, which results in lost work days and higher mortality/disability. This study utilizes data from the Border Epidemiologic Study on Aging to analyze the endogeneity of diabetes in an employment model. We use family history of diabetes as genetic instrumental variables. We show that assuming that diabetes is an exogenous variable results in an overestimate (underestimate) of the negative impact of diabetes on female (male) employment. Our results are particularly relevant in the case of populations where genetic predisposition has an important role in the etiology of diabetes.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Diabetes and employment productivity: does diabetes management matter?}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To determine whether labor market effects were the result of diabetes per se or rather depended on the degree to which diabetes was controlled through management of blood sugar levels. METHODS This study utilized data from a recently completed survey of households in Brownsville, Texas, a largely Mexican American community with a high prevalence of diabetes that is located on the Texas-Mexico border. Diabetes management, or control, was measured by blood sugar levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, and interaction terms. Methods used were probit and Heckman regression. RESULTS Management of diabetes did not appear to have a discernible impact on labor market outcomes in the short run. However, diabetes was negatively associated with male productivity, particularly in males' propensity to work. The new American Diabetes Association (ADA) definition of diabetes is based on having an A1C level of {\textless}6.5{\%}. Using the new ADA definition, diabetes was negatively associated with female productivity. Female productivity was also negatively associated with the new ADA definition of prediabetes (A1C levels between 5.7{\%} and 6.4{\%}). However, very few people with diabetes actually controlled their blood sugar or A1C levels. CONCLUSION These results imply that in order to avoid productivity losses associated with diabetes, more scarce prevention resources should be spent on prevention of the onset of diabetes than on the management of A1C for those already diagnosed with diabetes. For women, the prevention of prediabetes is key.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Medical care costs for diabetes associated with health disparities among adult Medicaid enrollees in North Carolina}}
      \field{abstract}{Health disparities for many diseases are large and long-standing in North Carolina and the nation. This study examines medical care costs for diabetes associated with health disparities among adults (age, {\textgreater} or =78 years) enrolled in Medicaid in North Carolina during state fiscal year (SFY) 2007-2008 (i.e., July 7, 2007, through June 30, 2008). North Carolina Medicaid paid claims and enrollment data were used to calculate the prevalence of and medical care expenditures for diabetes among adult Medicaid enrollees overall and by white, African American, and American Indian race. The impacts of racial and economic health disparities on medical care costs for diabetes were determined by first calculating the proportionate differences between the diabetes prevalence for whites, African Americans, and American Indians enrolled in Medicaid and the diabetes prevalence among all whites in North Carolina. Then it was assumed that medical care costs for white, African American, and American Indian Medicaid recipients could be reduced by the same proportion if the overall prevalence among whites was achieved. The diabetes prevalence among adult Medicaid enrollees was 75.7{\%}, compared with 9.1{\%} for all North Carolina adults. During SFY 2007-2008, the state Medicaid program in North Carolina spent {\$}525 million for diabetes-related medical care and prescription drugs among adults. An estimated {\$}225 million in diabetes-related expenditures could be saved each year by the North Carolina Medicaid program if both racial and economic disparities in the diabetes prevalence were eliminated. We did not have data on non-Medicaid paid health care expenditures for the Medicaid enrollees in our study. The costs of interventions to eliminate health disparities associated with diabetes are not included in the calculation of the potential savings. The diabetes prevalence in the Medicaid population is much greater than that for all North Carolinians, and the Medicaid costs associated with this elevated prevalence are large. North Carolina health-policy makers and health-program managers should carefully evaluate investments in interventions to reduce these race- and economic-based differences in diabetes prevalence, which could potentially reduce Medicaid costs.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Medicine prices, availability, and affordability in 36 developing and middle-income countries: a secondary analysis}}
      \field{abstract}{Background: WHO and Health Action International (HAI) have developed a standardised method for surveying medicine prices, availability, affordability, and price components in low-income and middle-income countries. Here, we present a secondary analysis of medicine availability in 45 national and subnational surveys done using the WHO/HAI methodology. Methods: Data from 45 WHO/HAI surveys in 36 countries were adjusted for inflation or deflation and purchasing power parity. International reference prices from open international procurements for generic products were used as comparators. Results are presented for 15 medicines included in at least 80{\%} of surveys and four individual medicines. Findings: Average public sector availability of generic medicines ranged from 29??4{\%} to 54??4{\%} across WHO regions. Median government procurement prices for 15 generic medicines were 1??11 times corresponding international reference prices, although purchasing efficiency ranged from 0??09 to 5??37 times international reference prices. Low procurement prices did not always translate into low patient prices. Private sector patients paid 9-25 times international reference prices for lowest-priced generic products and over 20 times international reference prices for originator products across WHO regions. Treatments for acute and chronic illness were largely unaffordable in many countries. In the private sector, wholesale mark-ups ranged from 2{\%} to 380{\%}, whereas retail mark-ups ranged from 10{\%} to 552{\%}. In countries where value added tax was applied to medicines, the amount charged varied from 4{\%} to 15{\%}. Interpretation: Overall, public and private sector prices for originator and generic medicines were substantially higher than would be expected if purchasing and distribution were efficient and mark-ups were reasonable. Policy options such as promoting generic medicines and alternative financing mechanisms are needed to increase availability, reduce prices, and improve affordability.

      \field{labeltitle}{{Differences in the availability of medicines for chronic and acute conditions in the public and private sectors of developing countries}}
      \field{abstract}{Objective: To investigate potential differences in the availability of medicines for chronic and acute conditions in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Data on the availability of 30 commonly-surveyed medicines – 15 for acute and 15 for chronic conditions – were obtained from facility-based surveys conducted in 40 developing countries. Results were aggregated by World Bank country income group and World Health Organization region. Findings: The availability of medicines for both acute and chronic conditions was suboptimal across countries, particularly in the public sector. Generic medicines for chronic conditions were significantly less available than generic medicines for acute conditions in both the public sector (36.0{\{}{\%}{\}} availability versus 53.5{\{}{\%}{\}}; P = 0.001) and the private sector (54.7{\{}{\%}{\}} versus 66.2{\{}{\%}{\}}; P = 0.007). Antiasthmatics, antiepileptics and antidepressants, followed by antihypertensives, were the drivers of the observed differences. An inverse association was found between country income level and the availability gap between groups of medicines, particularly in the public sector. In low- and lower-middle income countries, drugs for acute conditions were 33.9{\{}{\%}{\}} and 12.9{\{}{\%}{\}} more available, respectively, in the public sector than medicines for chronic conditions. Differences in availability were smaller in the private sector than in the public sector in all country income groups. Conclusion: Current disease patterns do not explain the significant gaps observed in the availability of medicines for chronic and acute conditions. Measures are needed to better respond to the epidemiological transition towards chronic conditions in developing countries alongside current efforts to scale up treatment for communicable diseases.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost-of-illness study of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Colombia}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To determine the per patient and overall cost of illness of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Colombia from Ministry of Health and societal perspectives. METHODS A published Markov transition model was adapted for Colombia, using the clinical expertise of a Colombian endocrinologist. Transition probabilities for the model were derived from an international literature review. A model was run for a time horizon of 42 years. Direct resources (drugs, laboratory, medical, hospital, other health care) were identified and cost was ascertained by using national price lists, international health care guidelines, and other Colombian studies or data from other countries. Indirect costs (work time lost) were calculated by using the human capital approach. Annual and lifetime direct and indirect costs, in 2007 U.S. dollars with a 5{\%} discount rate, were determined on a per patient basis and projected to the overall Colombian population. Costs were clustered according to treatments and outcomes. RESULTS The estimated annual cost was {\$}2.7 billion from the societal perspective and {\$}921 million from the Ministry of Health perspective. The annual direct cost per patient was {\$}288, and the indirect cost was {\$}559 (total = {\$}847). This cost was distributed across disease outcomes as follows: diabetes treatment (drugs), 47{\%}; cardiac and coronary disease, 24{\%}; stroke, 15{\%}; amputation, 9{\%}; nephropathy, 3{\%}; retinopathy, 2{\%}. Macrovascular complications made up 86{\%} of the annual direct costs and 95{\%} of the annual indirect costs of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS We estimated the annual cost of T2DM for Colombia from societal, Ministry of Health, and Colombian Health System perspectives. We also estimated annual direct cost per patient and the cost of treating diabetes and macrovascular complications. The economic burden is substantial and comparable to results for other countries. The model showed a logical disease progression.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The medical care costs of obesity: An instrumental variables approach}}
      \field{abstract}{This paper is the first to use the method of instrumental variables (IV) to estimate the impact of obesity on medical costs in order to address the endogeneity of weight and to reduce the bias from reporting error in weight. Models are estimated using restricted-use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2000-2005. The IV model, which exploits genetic variation in weight as a natural experiment, yields estimates of the impact of obesity on medical costs that are considerably higher than the estimates reported in the previous literature. For example, obesity is associated with {\$}656 higher annual medical care costs, but the IV results indicate that obesity raises annual medical costs by {\$}2741 (in 2005 dollars). These results imply that the previous literature has underestimated the medical costs of obesity, resulting in underestimates of the economic rationale for government intervention to reduce obesity-related externalities. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus in Hong Kong Chinese}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE Hong Kong (HK) is a special administrative region of China as well as being a metropolitan city. In HK, like in many developed countries, Diabetes mellitus, with over 97{\%} of diabetic patients having Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM), is a growing public health problem but the local financial burden has never been investigated. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate from the social perspective the costs of Type 2 DM, to identify the major cost drivers, and the proportion of the burden shared by the government, patient and the society. The study was carried out in a group of Hong Kong Chinese patients attending a government hospital. The economic impact of Type 2 DM on local and governmental healthcare expenditure was also examined. METHODS A retrospective cohort observational study was conducted in Type 2 DM patients attending the Diabetes Mellitus Outpatient Clinic at a public hospital in the period January 2004 to May 2004, in which 204 patients were randomly selected and invited to join this study. A total of 147 patients were subsequently enrolled giving an inclusion rate of 72{\%}. RESULTS Annual total cost of Type 2 DM in a patient was US{\$} 1,725 +/- 2,044 (HK{\$} 13,457 +/- 15,943) with direct costs accounting for {\textgreater} 87.9{\%}. The government was the major payer with over 78.4{\%} of the total costs. Annual total direct medical costs per patient were US{\$} 1,492 +/- 1,716 (HK{\$} 11,638 +/- 13,386) of which the government paid 90.6{\%}. Direct medical costs increased markedly if complications were present. In patients with microvascular or macrovascular complications only, the costs increased 1.1-fold compared to those for patients without complications. If both microvascular and macrovascular complications were present in the same patient, the costs were 1.3-fold higher than in patients without complications. CONCLUSION Costs of Type 2 DM have a significant impact on the local healthcare budget. It contributed in 2004 up to 3.9{\%} of the total HK healthcare expenditure and 6.4{\%} of the HK Hospital Authority's (public sector) expenditures on health.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Comorbidities, quality of life and patients' willingness to pay for a cure for type 2 diabetes in Taiwan}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVES Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in Taiwan. However, to date,no study has investigated the patient profile in this country.Therefore,this study aimed to analyse health condition,health-related quality of life and associated financial burden of people with diabetes in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN A cross-sectional survey was conducted using face-to-face interviews with patients with diabetes aged 18 years and over from four hospitals in northern Taiwan. A hypothetical scenario was designed to ascertain subjects' willingness to pay for a cure for diabetes. Ethical approval and consent were obtained from the patients and hospital ethics boards. METHODS A double-bounded dichotomous contingent valuation method and maximum log- likelihood model were employed to evaluate the cost of the disease in Taiwan. Anchoring effect .EQ-5D was employed to assess patients' health-related quality of life. RESULTS The main comorbidities reported were hypertension(52.2{\%}),cataract(34.3{\%})and loss of sight(24.3{\%}).The total cost of disease borne by each patient with diabetes is US{\$}3065.7 per year.The total cost of diabetes to society is approximately US{\$}2.96 billion, equivalent to approximately 0.8{\%} of the gross domestic product of Taiwan. The Bureau of National Health Insurance alleviates approximately one-third of the burden for patients. CONCLUSIONS The presence of specific comorbidities for patients with diabetes does not have a significant impact on their willingness to pay for a cure. However, body mass index, health- related quality of life and ability to decrease blood glucose level were significantly associated with willingness to pay. With ever-increasing health expenditures around the world,cost containment should start with preventive approaches. Health policies regarding the prevention of diabetes should focus on the promotion of life quality and fitness of the patients.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost of diabetes and its complications in Thailand: a complete picture of economic burden}}
      \field{abstract}{Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder with increasing burden in Thailand. The chronic nature along with associated complications makes the disease very costly. In Thailand, there exist some studies on cost of diabetes; however, those studies estimated the cost either from provider or from patient perspective. In order to capture the complete picture of economic burden caused by diabetes, using prevalence-based approach; the present study estimated the cost of illness of diabetes from societal perspective, the broadest viewpoint covering all costs irrespective of who incur them. Data were collected from 475 randomly selected diabetic patients who received treatment from Waritchaphum hospital in Sakhon Nakhon province of Thailand during 2007-2008 with a response rate of 98{\%}. A micro-costing approach was used to calculate the cost. The direct medical cost was calculated by multiplying the quantity of medical services consumed by their unit costs while indirect cost was calculated by using human capital approach. The total cost of illness of diabetes for 475 study participants was estimated as USD 418,696 for the financial year 2008 (1 USD = 32 THB). Of this, 23{\%} was direct medical cost, 40{\%} was direct non-medical cost and 37{\%} was indirect cost. The average cost of illness per diabetic patient was USD 881.47 in 2008 which was 21{\%} of per capita gross domestic product of Thailand. Existence of complications increased the cost substantially. Cost of informal care contributed 28{\%} of total cost of illness of diabetes. Therefore, the disease not only affected the individual but also the family members, friends and neighbours. The economic and social burden of the disease therefore emphasises the need for initiatives to prevent the disease prevalence and counselling to the diabetic patients to prevent the progression of the disease and its devastating complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The prevalence of chronic conditions and medical expenditures of the elderly by chronic condition indicator (CCI)}}
      \field{abstract}{The aim of this study was to understand the prevalence of chronic conditions and medical expenditures of the elderly for health care planning development of chronic conditions. This research is based on the representative sample (N=114,873) of seniors over 65 years nationwide. The CCI by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and clinical classifications software (CCS) were adopted to determine chronic condition diagnosis codes and classify the diseases. The results are presented by descriptive and multiple regression analysis. The chronic condition prevalence for seniors is 70.4{\%} and the medical expenditures for seniors with chronic conditions accounts for 92.7{\%} of the total medical expenditures for seniors, while 25{\%} of the medical expenditure is spent on 8.2{\%} of seniors who have five chronic conditions and above. Chronic conditions suffered by the elderly, in the order of its prevalence, are hypertension (36.1{\%}), COPD (23.7{\%}), and cataracts (16.7{\%}). From the viewpoint of annual average medical expenditures, cardiovascular diseases rank the most costly diseases, with average medical expenditures as high as {\$}4291. Urinary disease and diabetes ranks the second and the third most costly with an average expenditure of {\$}3644 and {\$}3594. This research showed that the average medical expenditure for seniors with chronic conditions is 5.4 times higher compared with seniors without chronic conditions. It is recommended to further study the characteristics of the target population that spends the most in medical expenditures to outline a more beneficial disease management model, reduce avoidable medical costs and achieve the goal of saving medical resources.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The direct medical cost of diabetes in Israel.}}
      \field{abstract}{Diabetes mellitus is an important chronic disease with a growing prevalence that absorbs an ever increasing investment of resources. This population-based study evaluated the direct medical costs of diabetes mellitus in an HMO setting. We evaluated both the total cost of diabetic patients and their added cost in comparison to other HMO members (diabetes-related costs). Data were obtained for the years 1999-2001 in a cohort of 24,632 diabetic patients followed up for 3 years drawn from the computerized medical administrative database of a large HMO in Israel, insuring around 25{\%} of the population. The mean direct cost of the medical treatment of a diabetic patient rose 29{\%} from US {\$}2,017 in 1999 to {\$}2,601 in 2001 (in 2001 terms) in comparison to a 19.7{\%} rise (from {\$}1,246 to {\$}1,492). Hospitalizations, medication, and physician visits account for 39{\%}, 29{\%}, and 21{\%} of the total diabetic patient costs, respectively. Dialysis, insulin intake, impaired creatinine, and elevated HbA1c were associated with increased expenditures. According to our results, the total national medical cost of diabetes alone in 2001 was {\$}317 million and that of diabetic patients was {\$}564 million, 6.9{\%} and 12.4{\%} of the total Israeli HMO budget, respectively. The study presents the use of a population-based computerized database to comprehensively assess the economic burden of disease and the potential savings from prevention. The study data suggest a rise in the cost of diabetes which has implications for prevention and treatment policies.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The Assessment of Chronic Health Conditions on Work Performance, Absence, and Total Economic Impact for Employers}}
      \field{abstract}{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and estimate total costs for chronic health conditions in the U.S. workforce for the Dow Chemical Company (Dow). Methods: Using the Stanford Presenteeism Scale, information was collected from workers at five locations on work impairment and absenteeism based on self-reported "primary" chronic health conditions. Survey data were merged with employee demographics, medical and pharmaceutical claims, smoking status, biometric health risk factors, payroll records, and job type. Results: Almost 65{\%} of respondents reported having one or more of the surveyed chronic conditions. The most common were allergies, arthritis/joint pain or stiffness, and back or neck disorders. The associated absenteeism by chronic condition ranged from 0.9 to 5.9 hours in a 4-week period, and on-the-job work impairment ranged from a 17.8{\%} to 36.4{\%} decrement in ability to function at work. The presence of a chronic condition was the most important determinant of the reported levels of work impairment and absence after adjusting for other factors (P {\textless} 0.000). The total cost of chronic conditions was estimated to be 10.7{\%} of the total labor costs for Dow in the United States; 6.8{\%} was attributable to work impairment alone. Conclusion: For all chronic conditions studied, the cost associated with performance based work loss or "presenteeism" greatly exceeded the combined costs of absenteeism and medical treatment combined.

      \field{labeltitle}{{Using natural experiments to evaluate population health interventions: new Medical Research Council guidance.}}
      \field{abstract}{Natural experimental studies are often recommended as a way of understanding the health impact of policies and other large scale interventions. Although they have certain advantages over planned experiments, and may be the only option when it is impossible to manipulate exposure to the intervention, natural experimental studies are more susceptible to bias. This paper introduces new guidance from the Medical Research Council to help researchers and users, funders and publishers of research evidence make the best use of natural experimental approaches to evaluating population health interventions. The guidance emphasises that natural experiments can provide convincing evidence of impact even when effects are small or take time to appear. However, a good understanding is needed of the process determining exposure to the intervention, and careful choice and combination of methods, testing of assumptions and transparent reporting is vital. More could be learnt from natural experiments in future as experience of promising but lesser used methods accumulates.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Economic costs of diabetes in the US in 2002}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE - Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death by disease in the U.S. Diabetes also contributes to higher rates of morbidity - people with diabetes are at higher risk for heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, extremity amputations, and other chronic conditions. The objectives of this study were 1) to estimate the direct medical and indirect productivity-related costs attributable to diabetes and 2) to calculate and compare the total and per capita medical expenditures for people with and without diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Medical expenditures were estimated for the U.S. population with and without diabetes in 2002 by sex, age, race/ethnicity, type of medical condition, and health care setting. Health care use and total health care expenditures attributable to diabetes were estimated using etiological fractions, calculated based on national health care survey data. The value of lost productivity attributable to diabetes was also estimated based on estimates of lost workdays, restricted activity days, prevalence of permanent disability, and mortality attributable to diabetes. RESULTS - Direct medical and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in 2002 were estimated at {\$}132 billion. Direct medical expenditures alone totaled {\$}91.8 billion and comprised {\$}23.2 billion for diabetes care, {\$}24.6 billion for chronic complications attributable to diabetes, and {\$}44.1 billion for excess prevalence of general medical conditions. Inpatient days (43.9{\%}), nursing home care (15.1{\%}), and office visits (10.9{\%}) constituted the major expenditure groups by service settings. In addition, 51.8{\%} of direct medical expenditures were incurred by people {\textgreater}65 years old. Attributable indirect expenditures resulting from lost workdays, restricted activity days, mortality, and permanent disability due to diabetes totaled {\$}39.8 billion. U.S. health expenditures for the health care components included in the study totaled {\$}865 billion, of which {\$}160 billion was incurred by people with diabetes. Per capita medical expenditures totaled {\$}13,243 for people with diabetes and {\$}2,560 for people without diabetes. When adjusting for differences in age, sex, and age group/ethnicity between the population with and without diabetes, people with diabetes had medical expenditures that were {\~{}}2.4 times higher than expenditures that would be incurred by the same group in the absence of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS - The estimated {\$}132 billion cost likely underestimates the true burden of diabetes because it omits intangibles, such as pain and suffering, care provided by nonpaid caregivers, and several areas of health care spending where people with diabetes probably use services at higher rates than people without diabetes (e.g., dental care, optometry care, and the use of licensed dietitians). In addition, the cost estimate excludes undiagnosed cases of diabetes. Health care spending in 2002 for people with diabetes is more than double what spending would be without diabetes. Diabetes imposes a substantial cost burden to society and, in particular, to those individuals with diabetes and their families. Eliminating or reducing the health problems caused by diabetes through factors such as better access to preventive care, more widespread diagnosis, more intensive disease management, and the advent of new medical technologies could significantly improve the quality of life for people with diabetes and their families while at the same time potentially reducing national expenditures for health care services and increasing productivity in the U.S. economy.}

      \field{abstract}{New research provides revised comprehensive estimates that suggest that the U.S. national economic burden of pre-diabetes and diabetes reached {\$}218 billion in 2007. This estimate includes {\$}153 billion in higher medical costs and {\$}65 billion in reduced productivity.

      \field{labeltitle}{{The obesity-driven rising costs of type 2 diabetes in Australia: projections from the Fremantle Diabetes Study}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND The cost of diabetes is high for both the individual and society. Future health-care planning requires patient-level diabetes-attributable health-care cost data that have not previously been available for Australia. AIM To determine Australian national direct diabetes-attributable health-care costs for known type 2 diabetes in 2000 and project these to 2051. METHODS A total of 1294 patients with type 2 diabetes was recruited to the Fremantle Diabetes Study between 1993 and 1996. A bottom-up, prevalence-based approach using diabetes-attributable costs provided average annual per patient health-care costs (in year 2000 A{\$}). Costs were extrapolated to 2051 using Australian type 2 diabetes prevalence figures and Australian Bureau of Statistics population projections, assuming that prevalence rates (i) remain at current levels and (ii) rise steadily. RESULTS Total annual direct diabetes-attributable health-care costs in 2000 in Australia for people {\textgreater} or =25 years with known type 2 diabetes were estimated at A{\$}636 million. As a result of ageing, the number of people with type 2 diabetes will double between 2000 and 2051 with a 2.5-fold increase in diabetes-attributable health-care costs. If obesity and inactivity prevalence rates continue to rise, prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes will further increase. The number of people with type 2 diabetes in 2051 may be 3.5 times higher than in 2000 with a 3.7-fold cost increase. CONCLUSIONS The financial burden of treating type 2 diabetes could quadruple by 2051 unless more is done to prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications. A smaller proportion of the population will have the capacity to fund these rising health-care costs.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The economic cost of diabetes in Canada, 1998.}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: In Canada, diabetes poses a significant health problem, and current estimates of its economic burden have not incorporated the total cost of the disease. The objective of this study was to quantify the direct medical- and mortality-related productivity cost of diabetes in Canada for 1998. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Direct medical costs included hospital services, physician services, and medicines consumed by people with diabetes. These costs were based on a top-down costing methodology that allocated 1998 total medical expenditures to diabetes. The prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes and the relative risk of complications in people with diabetes were used to estimate the proportion of medical services that were consumed by people with diabetes. Mortality-related productivity losses were calculated using the human capital approach. RESULTS: After varying the assumptions in a sensitivity analysis, the total economic burden (in U.S. dollars) of diabetes and its chronic complications in Canada for 1998 was likely to be between {\$}4.76 and {\$}5.23 billion. In those people just with diagnosed diabetes, the direct medical costs associated with diabetes care, before considering any complications, were {\$}573 million. Of the costs associated with the complications of diabetes, cardiovascular disease was by far the greatest, at {\$}637 million. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease was the major contributor to the direct costs of diabetes. The preventive management of diabetes should receive priority attention, and the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the patient with diabetes should become an imperative.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Comparing the national economic burden of five chronic conditions}}
      \field{abstract}{Using a nationally representative sample of 23,230 U.S. residents, we examine patterns of economic burden across five chronic conditions: mood disorders, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and hypertension. Almost half of U.S. health care costs in 1996 were borne by persons with one or more of these five conditions; of that spending amount, only about one-quarter was spent on treating the conditions themselves and the remainder on coexistent illnesses. Each condition demonstrated substantial economic burden but also unique characteristics and patterns of service use driving those costs. The findings highlight the differing challenges involved in understanding needs and improving care across particular chronic conditions.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To assess the incremental economic burden of privately insured patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in 2000 and 2005 in the United States. METHODS Adults with T2DM and 24 months of continuous health plan enrollment were identified in the MarketScan databases (2000 and 2005). Control groups of persons without diabetes were selected for comparison using propensity score matching. Total adjusted health care costs were estimated using generalized linear modeling. RESULTS Adjusted health care costs of patients with T2DM in 2005 were 136{\%} higher than those of the matched controls ({\$}12,733 vs {\$}5406, P {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, costs of patients with T2DM in 2000 were 146{\%} higher than those of the matched controls ({\$}12,423 vs {\$}5058, P {\textless} 0.001). Expenditures were similar for individuals with T2DM in 2000 and 2005. CONCLUSIONS T2DM continues to impose a substantial economic burden to self-insured employers.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Direct costs for care and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in Sudan.}}
      \field{abstract}{The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution by type 2 diabetic patients in a low-income country from their own income in attempting to control the disease and to prevent chronic diabetes complications through good glycaemic control. Socio-economic and demographic data for study subjects were obtained from 822 adult diabetic patients attending public or private diabetic clinics in Khartoum State, Sudan. The average annual income of diabetic patients was estimated as USD 1.923. The direct cost of diabetes control was USD 175 per year. This included cost of drugs and ambulatory care, although drug supply was insufficient for 52{\%} of the patients. Glycosylated hemoglobin as a measure of glycaemic control was determined to be unsatisfactory in 77{\%} of patients. This gives an immediate indication that current practices in diabetes control in urban Sudan are not cost-effective. Patients attending private clinics had a higher income and cost of diabetes control than those attending public clinics. However, both groups had similar proportion of poor glycaemic control, which reflects the insufficient care given to diabetic patients, mainly due to deficient resources and inefficient utilization of what is scarcely available.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The economic costs of diabetes: a population-based study in Tehran, Iran}}
      \field{abstract}{AIM/HYPOTHESIS The aim of the study was to determine the annual healthcare expenditures of an individual with diabetes in Tehran, between March 2004 and March 2005. METHODS This prevalence-based 'cost-of-illness' study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, 23,707 randomly selected individuals were interviewed to gather a cohort of participants with diabetes. In the second phase, 710 diabetic patients and 904 age- and sex-matched controls were followed up for 1 year at intervals of 3 months and the direct (physician services, medications and devices, hospitalisation, laboratory, paraclinical and transport) and indirect (loss of productivity) expenditures were recorded. The excess costs of a person with diabetes were estimated through comparison with matched controls. The estimates were also extrapolated to the total population of Tehran and Iran. The costs were converted from the Iranian rial to the US dollar (exchange rate September 2004). RESULTS Total annual direct costs of diabetic and control participants were {\$}152.3 +/- 14.5 and {\$}52.0 +/- 5.8, respectively, which is indicative of 2.92 times higher costs in diabetic patients. The most expensive components of direct costs were medications and devices, and hospitalisation in diabetic patients (28.7{\%} and 28.6{\%}, respectively). Total indirect costs were {\$}39.6 +/- 2.4 and {\$}16.7 +/- 1.1 in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. The aggregate annual direct costs of diabetes were estimated to be {\$}112.424 +/- 10.732 million and {\$}590.676 +/- 65.985 million in Tehran and Iran, respectively. Diabetes complications contributed 53{\%} of the aggregate excess direct costs of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION Diabetes is an expensive medical problem in Iran and planning of national programmes for its control and prevention is necessary.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost-of-illness studies in diabetes mellitus}}
      \field{abstract}{Several cost-of-illness (COI) studies related to diabetes mellitus have been performed over the last three decades. This review examines the results of these COI studies, identifies the strengths and limitations of the various methods utilised, and suggests future research that will help determine the economic burden of diabetes more accurately. Diabetes imposes a large economic burden on society. The economic cost of diabetes is estimated to be as much as dollars US 100 billion per year in the US alone (1997 values). This estimated cost has increased notably over time, primarily due to price inflation and the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Differing methodologies have significantly influenced the cost estimates and made comparisons between COI studies problematic. For example, early reports tended to rely exclusively on data where diabetes was listed as the primary diagnosis or reason for healthcare use. To better capture the costs associated with diabetes-related complications, later studies have included costs related to diabetes as a secondary or tertiary diagnosis using the attributable risk methodology. Given the types of long-term complications that are associated with diabetes, attempts at capturing these secondary costs are appropriate. However, estimates of attributable risk can be limited by the epidemiological data currently available. The tremendous economic burden of diabetes makes the disease an important clinical and public health problem. In order to formulate an effective response to this problem, it is important to track future economic trends as healthcare delivery, morbidity and mortality patterns evolve. Future research efforts should focus on refining methods to estimate costs, improving the interpretation of study findings, and facilitating comparisons between studies.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Demand for health care in Denmark: results of a national sample survey using contingent valuation}}
      \field{abstract}{In this paper we use willingness to pay (WTP) to elicit values for private insurance covering treatment for four different health problems. By way of obtaining these values, we test the viability of the contingent valuation method (CVM) and econometric techniques, respectively, as means of eliciting and analysing values from the general public. WTP responses from a Danish national sample survey, which was designed in accordance with existing guidelines, are analysed in terms of consistency and validity checks. Large numbers of zero responses are common in WTP studies, and are found here; therefore, the Heckman selectivity model and log-transformed OLS are employed. The selectivity model is rejected, but test results indicate that the lognormal model yields efficient and unbiased estimates. The results give confidence in the WTP estimates obtained and, more generally, in CVM as a means of valuing publicly provided goods and in econometrics as a tool for analysing WTP results containing many zero responses.

      \field{abstract}{Reducing chronic disease has been identified as a priority for both health and labour force participation. This study estimates the influence of clinically diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular disease on labour supply in men and women aged 25 years and over, taking account of the observed and unobserved factors that influence both the risk of these chronic diseases and labour force participation. The results show that diabetes and cardiovascular disease together have a strong impact on labour market outcomes, particularly for men, and that obesity, insufficient exercise, hypertension, lipid abnormality, smoking, and parental diabetes all have significant indirect effects on labour force participation.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Familial Risks for Type 2 Diabetes in Sweden}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize familial risks for type 2 diabetes by the type and number of affected family members, including half-siblings, adoptees, and spouses, to quantify risks and estimate the contribution of environmental effect. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Families were identified from the Multigeneration Register, and type 2 diabetic patients were obtained from the Hospital Discharge Register. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for offspring with type 2 diabetes whose family members were hospitalized for type 2 diabetes at ages {\textgreater}39 years compared with those lacking affected family members. RESULTS: The number of hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients was 157,549. Among 27,895 offspring, 27.9{\%} had a parent or sibling also hospitalized for type 2 diabetes. The familial relative risk (RR) ranged from 2.0 to {\textgreater}30, depending on the number and type of probands. The highest RRs of type 2 diabetes were found in individuals who had at least two siblings affected by type 2 diabetes, irrespective of the parental disease. Adoptees showed no risk from adopted parents. CONCLUSIONS: The study, the largest yet published, showed that familial RRs varied by the number and type of affected family member. However, much of the familial clustering remains yet to be genetically explained. The high risk should be recognized in clinical genetic counseling. The data from adoptees confirmed the genetic basis of the familial associations, but those from half siblings and spouses suggested that a smaller part of familial clustering may be accounted for by environmental factors.}

      \field{abstract}{T(2)ARDIS is a study of the full costs of care for a sample of people with type 2 diabetes in the UK. This paper reports on individual earnings lost by patients (n=653) and carers (n=253) aged {\textless}65 years, based on 1998 values. Mean annual lost earnings are calculated on three different bases. Across the total survey population aged {\textless}65 years, mean lost earnings are estimated at pound 869 (S.D. pound 4109) per patient and pound 1300 (S.D. pound 4093) per carer. However, for the sub-set of respondents who actually lose earnings, the mean levels are pound 13841 (S.D. pound 9551) and pound 10960 (S.D. pound 6002), respectively. Patients and carers who lose earnings incur higher personal care-related expenditure than those who do not lose earnings (although for the patients this is not statistically significant). Patients who lose earnings also report poorer health-related quality of life and carers who lose earnings report higher levels of strain. Only one third of carers report receiving state benefits, and for both carers and patients the shortfall between reported benefits received and lost earnings is substantial. A strong association was found between patients' loss of earnings and the presence of diabetic complications (P{\textless}0.001), especially micro-vascular complications. Policy priorities should, therefore, include facilitating comprehensive access to state benefits (especially for carers) and a clear focus on reducing the incidence of diabetic complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Comparing cost-of-illness estimates from alternative approaches: an application to diabetes}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To compare disease cost estimates from two commonly used approaches. DATA SOURCE Pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data for 1998-2003. STUDY DESIGN We compared regression-based (RB) and attributable fraction (AF) approaches for estimating disease-attributable costs with an application to diabetes. The RB approach used results from econometric models of disease costs, while the AF approach used epidemiologic formulas for diabetes-attributable fractions combined with the total costs for seven conditions that result from diabetes. DATA EXTRACTION We used SAS version 9.1 to create a dataset that combined data from six consecutive years of MEPS. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The RB approach produced higher estimates of diabetes-attributable medical spending ({\$}52.9 billion in 2004 dollars) than the AF approach ({\$}37.1 billion in 2004 dollars). RB model estimates may in part be higher because of the challenges of implementing the two approaches in a similar manner, but may also be higher because they capture the costs of increased treatment intensity for those with the disease. CONCLUSIONS We recommend using the RB approach for estimating disease costs whenever individual-level data on health care spending are available and when the presence of the disease affects treatment costs for other conditions, as in the case of diabetes.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{A comparative study of two various models of organising diabetes follow-up in public primary health care - the model influences the use of services, their quality and costs.}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: In Finland diabetologists have long been concerned about the level of diabetes care as the incidence of type 1 diabetes and complicated type 2 diabetes is exceeding the capacity of specialist clinics. We compared the outcome of diabetes care in two middle-sized Finnish municipalities with different models of diabetes care organisation in public primary health care. In Kouvola the primary health care of all diabetic patients is based on general practitioners, whereas in Nurmij{\"{a}}rvi the follow-up of type 1 and most complicated type 2 diabetic patients is assigned to a general practitioner specialised in diabetes care. METHODS: Our study population consisted of all adult diabetic patients living in the municipalities under review.We compared the use and costs of public diabetes care, glycemic control, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol level, the application of the national guidelines and patient satisfaction. The main outcome measures were the costs and use of health care services due to diabetes and its complications. RESULTS: In Nurmij{\"{a}}rvi, where diabetes care was centralised, more type 1 diabetic patients were followed up in primary health care than in Kouvola, where general practitioners need more specialist consultations. The centralisation resulted in cost savings in the diabetes care of type 1 diabetic patients. Although the quality of care was similar, type 1 diabetic patients were more satisfied with their follow-up in the centralised system. In the care of type 2 diabetic patients the centralised system required fewer specialist consultations, but the quality and costs were similar in both models. CONCLUSIONS: The follow-up of most diabetic patients - including type 1 diabetes - can be organised in primary health care with the same quality as in secondary care units. The centralised primary care of type 1 diabetes is less costly and requires fewer specialist consultations.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{[Pharmacoeconomy of diabetes mellitus--trends in the Czech Republic]}}
      \field{abstract}{Since 2002, we found relatively stable number of diabetes mellitus cases among clients of General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic. This means, after calculating incidence rate with respect to decline in total numbers of insured during the same period, a 6{\%} increase in real incidence rate. On the doctors side, outpatient, mostly private diabetologists have about the same capacity of their offices, 2.9 physicians (WTE)/100 000 citizens over the last years. Analysis of costs and volume of services provided, clearly demonstrate, that diabetology is medical specialization of a great importance not only from the point of view of number of patients and services provided but also of its influence on the overall health care costs. Data show not only higher average expenses for treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus compared to average expenses incurred for treatments of all other diagnoses, but show also a crucial relationship of costs with presence or absence of diabetes mellitus complications. Money spend by the medical insurance system and also and more importantly health profit to patients can thus be substantially influenced via improvements in organization of care, via higher involvement, compliance of patients to the treatment and to necessary change in their lifestyles and last but not least via increase in quality of care. Cost control can be achieved by strengthening the role of pharmacoeconomics in decisions making processes of health insurance companies, importance of which is demonstrated on the past developments on drug market in the Czech Republic. General Health Insurance Company will target these goals in coming years and in its business plans will also include expected increases of costs for organization of care and for higher renumeration of physicians as well.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Globalization of diabetes: the role of diet, lifestyle, and genes.}}
      \field{abstract}{Type 2 diabetes is a global public health crisis that threatens the economies of all nations, particularly developing countries. Fueled by rapid urbanization, nutrition transition, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the epidemic has grown in parallel with the worldwide rise in obesity. Asia's large population and rapid economic development have made it an epicenter of the epidemic. Asian populations tend to develop diabetes at younger ages and lower BMI levels than Caucasians. Several factors contribute to accelerated diabetes epidemic in Asians, including the "normal-weight metabolically obese" phenotype; high prevalence of smoking and heavy alcohol use; high intake of refined carbohydrates (e.g., white rice); and dramatically decreased physical activity levels. Poor nutrition in utero and in early life combined with overnutrition in later life may also play a role in Asia's diabetes epidemic. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology, but currently identified genetic loci are insufficient to explain ethnic differences in diabetes risk. Nonetheless, interactions between Westernized diet and lifestyle and genetic background may accelerate the growth of diabetes in the context of rapid nutrition transition. Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials show that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable through diet and lifestyle modifications. Translating these findings into practice, however, requires fundamental changes in public policies, the food and built environments, and health systems. To curb the escalating diabetes epidemic, primary prevention through promotion of a healthy diet and lifestyle should be a global public policy priority.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost-of-illness analysis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Iran.}}
      \field{abstract}{INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a worldwide high prevalence chronic progressive disease that poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed economic burden of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications in Iran in 2009 year. METHODS: This is a prevalence-based cost-of-illness study focusing on quantifying direct health care costs by bottom-up approach. Data on inpatient hospital services, outpatient clinic visits, physician services, drugs, laboratory test, education and non-medical cost were collected from two national registries. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs separately in male and female and also among different age groups. RESULTS: The total national cost of diagnosed T2DM in 2009 is estimated at 3.78 billion USA dollars (USD) including 2.04±0.28 billion direct (medical and non-medical) costs and indirect costs of 1.73 million. Average direct and indirect cost per capita was 842.6±102 and 864.8 USD respectively. Complications (48.9{\%}) and drugs (23.8{\%}) were main components of direct cost. The largest components of medical expenditures attributed to diabetes's complications are cardiovascular disease (42.3{\%} of total Complications cost), nephropathy (23{\%}) and ophthalmic complications (14{\%}). Indirect costs include temporarily disability (335.7 million), permanent disability (452.4 million) and reduced productivity due to premature mortality (950.3 million). CONCLUSIONS: T2DM is a costly disease in the Iran healthcare system and consume more than 8.69{\%} of total health expenditure. In addition to these quantified costs, T2DM imposes high intangible costs on society in terms of reduced quality of life. Identification of effective new strategies for the control of diabetes and its complications is a public health priority.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Health care use and costs in the decade after identification of type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a population-based study}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To analyze trends in health care costs in the decade after identification of diabetes, contrasting type 1 and 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Canadian National Diabetes Surveillance System criteria were applied to administrative databases to identify incident diabetes cases in 1992. Cases were categorized as type 1 or type 2 diabetes based on patterns of drug use. Per capita health care costs (in 2001 Canadian dollars) for five resource categories were estimated according to the type of diabetes, for the year before identification (1991) and 10 years after (1992-2001) identification of the cases. RESULTS We identified 156 type 1 and 3,469 type 2 incident cases of diabetes, from a population base of approximately 950,000. The mean (+/-SD) age of case subjects at index was 61.2 +/- 16.7 years, and 54{\%} of subjects were male. Overall annual per capita health expenditures rose considerably in the year after identification of diabetes but then stabilized at a lower level for the next 9 years, ranging from {\$}3,800 to {\$}4,400. From 1992 to 2001, diabetic individuals used {\$}137.1 million in health care resources, most of which (96{\%}) was attributable to type 2 diabetes. The average 10-year cost per individual with diabetes was {\$}37,820 ({\$}33,684 per type 1 and {\$}38,006 per type 2 diabetes case; adjusted P = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS Total health expenditures for diabetes are driven by the much larger prevalence of type 2 compared with type 1 diabetes. Policymakers need to acknowledge and allocate resources for diabetes prevention and management accordingly.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Revealing the cost of Type II diabetes in Europe}}
      \field{abstract}{AIMS/HYPOTHESIS 'The Cost of Diabetes in Europe - Type II study' is the first coordinated attempt to measure total healthcare costs of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in Europe. The study evaluated more than 7000 patients with Type II diabetes in eight countries -- Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. METHODS A bottom-up, prevalence-based design was used, which optimised the collection of data at the national level while maintaining maximum international comparability. Effort was made to ensure consistency in terms of data specification, data collection tools and methods, sampling design, and the analysis and reporting of results. Results are reported for individual countries and in aggregate for the total study population. RESULTS The total direct medical costs of Type II diabetes in the eight European countries was estimated at EUR 29 billion a year (1999 values). The estimated average yearly cost per patient was EUR 2834 a year. Of these costs, hospitalisations accounted for the greatest proportion (55{\%}, range 30-65{\%}) totalling EUR 15.9 billion for the eight countries. During the 6-month evaluation period, 13{\%} of the Type II diabetic patients were hospitalised, with an average of 23 days in hospital projected annually. In contrast, drug costs for managing Type II diabetes were relatively low, with antidiabetic drugs and insulin accounting for only 7{\%} of the total healthcare costs for Type II diabetes. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION Type II diabetes mellitus is a common disease and the prevalence is expected to increase considerably in the future, especially in developing countries. Current comprehensive economic data on the costs of diabetes are required for policy decisions to optimise resource allocation and to evaluate different approaches for disease management.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost of diabetes care in out-patient clinics of Karachi, Pakistan}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a growing epidemic and the cost of treating diabetes is largely increasing. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-of-illness of DM among attendees of out-patient clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. This is the first study conducted from a societal perspective to estimate the cost of managing diabetes in Pakistan. METHODS: A prevalence-based 'Cost-of-Illness' study for diabetes care was conducted in six different out-patient clinics of Karachi, Pakistan from July to September 2006. A pre-tested questionnaire was administered to collect the data from 345 randomly selected persons with diabetes. RESULTS: The annual mean direct cost for each person with diabetes was estimated to be Pakistani rupees 11,580 (US{\$} 197). Medicines accounted for the largest share of direct cost (46{\%}), followed by laboratory investigations (32{\%}). We found that increased age, the number of complications and longer duration of the disease significantly increase the burden of cost on society (p {\textless} 0.001). Comparing cost with family income it was found that the poorest segment of society is spending 18{\%} of total family income on diabetes care. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that substantial expenditure is incurred by people with diabetes; with the implication that resources could be saved by prevention, earlier detection and a reduction in diabetes co-morbidities and complications through improved diabetes care. Large scale and cost-effective prevention programs need to be initiated to maximise health gains and to reverse the advance of this epidemic.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Economic burden of diabetes mellitus in the WHO African region.}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: In 2000, the prevalence of diabetes among the 46 countries of the WHO African Region was estimated at 7.02 million people. Evidence from North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean indicates that diabetes exerts a heavy health and economic burden on society. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of such evidence in the WHO African Region. The objective of this study was to estimate the economic burden associated with diabetes mellitus in the countries in the African Region. METHODS: Drawing information from various secondary sources, this study used standard cost-of-illness methods to estimate: (a) the direct costs, i.e. those borne by the health systems and the families in directly addressing the problem; and (b) the indirect costs, i.e. the losses in productivity attributable to premature mortality, permanent disability and temporary disability caused by the disease. Prevalence estimates of diabetes for the year 2000 were used to calculate direct and indirect costs of diabetes mellitus. A discount rate of 3{\%} was used to convert future earnings lost into their present values. The economic burden analysis was done for three groups of countries, i.e. 6 countries whose gross national income (GNI) per capita was greater than 8000 international dollars (i.e. in purchasing power parity), 6 countries with Int{\$}2000-7999 and 33 countries with less than Int{\$}2000. GNI for Zimbabwe was missing. RESULTS: The 7.02 million cases of diabetes recorded by countries of the African Region in 2000 resulted in a total economic loss of Int{\$}25.51 billion (PPP). Approximately 43.65{\%}, 10.03{\%} and 46.32{\%} of that loss was incurred by groups 1, 2 and 3 countries, respectively. This translated into grand total economic loss of Int{\$}11,431.6, Int{\$}4,770.6 and Int{\$} 2,144.3 per diabetes case per year in the three groups respectively. CONCLUSION: In spite of data limitations, the estimates reported here show that diabetes imposes a substantial economic burden on countries of the WHO African Region. That heavy burden underscores the urgent need for increased investments in the prevention and management of diabetes.}

      \field{abstract}{AIMS/HYPOTHESIS The aim of this study was to identify the health care costs of diabetic patients in Germany in 2001, focusing on the influence of age, sex, and type of treatment. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Annual direct costs of medical care and indirect costs of inability to work and early retirement in diabetic subjects were compared with costs of age- and sex-matched non-diabetic control subjects. The analysis was based on routine health care data from a random sample (18.75{\%}) taken from a database of 1.9 million insured persons. Incremental differences in medical and national expenditure between subjects with and without diabetes were calculated. RESULTS Annual direct mean costs per diabetic patient were 5,262 Euro, and indirect costs were 5,019 Euro. In the control group, mean direct and indirect costs were 2,755 Euro and 3,691 Euro, respectively. Analysis of cost components revealed that the high costs associated with the care of diabetic patients could be largely attributed to inpatient care and overall medication costs. Hypoglycaemic drugs amounted to only one-quarter of the medication costs. The total health care costs were correlated with the type of treatment. Direct excess costs increased with increasing age in insulin-treated patients, but were unaffected by age in patients receiving other types of treatment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION The Costs of Diabetes Mellitus (CoDiM) study is the first comprehensive study to provide estimates of costs associated with diabetes care in Germany. Direct costs of diabetic patients account for 14.2{\%} of total health care costs, which includes the proportion that specifically accounts for diabetes-related costs (6.8{\%}).}

      \field{abstract}{Cost of illness studies create transparency on the economic dimension of diseases. By now, the CoDiM study, based on administrative data of AOK Hesse und KV Hesse, identifies costs of people with diabetes and diabetes related excess costs in Germany for a period of 10 years. To date, additionally adjusted results are available by accounting for effects caused by inflation and ageing of the population. From 2000 to 2009 the number of treated patients with diabetes increased by 49 {\%}, adjusted for age by 31 {\%}. Mean cost of patients with diabetes and diabetes related excess costs per capita turned out to be relatively stable over the time period observed. The relation of cost per patient with diabetes to cost of patients without diabetes didn't change. Due to the increase of the number of treated patients with diabetes in the past 10 years, the total direct cost, dependant on the approach of calculation (adjusting or not for inflation and ageing effects), rose by 28 {\%} to 70 {\%}, the therein included diabetes excess cost by 24 {\%} to 61 {\%}.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Impact of diabetes on employment and income in Manitoba, Canada}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE - To compare employment and income of working-age (18-64 years) people with and without diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study based in Manitoba, Canada, consisting of 25,554 individuals without diabetes and 608 with diabetes, of whom 242 had a complication of the disease. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of employment and income variables were determined. RESULTS - Diabetic individuals with complications were twice as likely not to be in the labor force (OR 2.07 [95{\%} CI 1.49-2.87]) than nondiabetic individuals. This difference was not evident for diabetic individuals without complications (OR 1.20 [0.93-1.56]). Diabetic individuals without complications had incomes similar to those of nondiabetic individuals. The total income of diabetic individuals with complications was 72{\%} of the income of nondiabetic individuals. When the analysis was limited to only those in the labor force, diabetic workers with complications still had only 85{\%} the employment income of nondiabetic people. Diabetic individuals with complications received 58{\%} more social support income. In a separate analysis of aboriginal individuals, complicated diabetes was not associated with an increased likelihood of not working or a decrease in employment income. CONCLUSIONS - In general, complications of diabetes and the absence of the disease affect the ability to earn income in Manitoba, Canada. This effect was not identified in the aboriginal population of the province.}

      \field{abstract}{Cost-of-illness (COI) studies aim to assess the economic burden of health problems on the population overall, and they are conducted for an ever widening range of health conditions and geographical settings. While they attract much interest from public health advocates and healthcare policy makers, inconsistencies in the way in which they are conducted and a lack of transparency in reporting have made interpretation difficult, and have ostensibly limited their usefulness. Yet there is surprisingly little in the literature to assist the non-expert in critically evaluating these studies. This article aims to provide non-expert readers with a straightforward guide to understanding and evaluating traditional COI studies. The intention is to equip a general audience with an understanding of the most important issues that influence the validity of a COI study, and the ability to recognize the most common limitations in such work.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper examines the impact of diabetes on the employment of Canadian males and females ages 15-64. Using data from the National Population Health Survey (1998), it utilizes a recursive bivariate probit approach to take into account the potential endogeneity of diabetes in employment outcomes. The results suggest that treating diabetes as exogenous yields an over-estimation of its impact on male employment. The study finds that diabetes has a significant negative impact on female employment probability, but has no significant impact on that of nonwhite Canadians. An implication thus is that policy-makers should take endogeneity into account in estimating labor market costs of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Copyright 2008 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Objective: Predict diabetes prevalence and costs to assist in policy decision-making with respect to diabetes prevention and treatment strategies. Methods: The model was developed based on observed epidemiologic data (incidence, prevalence and mortality rates) and healthcare cost data from the Alberta Diabetes Surveillance System (ADSS) and population projections from Alberta Health and Wellness. Patterns of changing incidence and mortality from 1995 to 2007 were extracted from the ADSS data using regression models. Using these data, a cohort life table model of the Alberta population was created that projected the population's yearly progression into diabetic states for 5-year age bands, stratified for men and women. Diabetes prevalence and healthcare costs from the government perspective were projected for 2008 to 2035. Results: If current trends continue, overall diabetes prevalence in Alberta will more than double between 2007 and 2035 from approximately 4.5{\%} to 11.1{\%}, with the greatest increases in older adults (age {\textgreater}=70). Healthcare costs were projected to increase by 237{\%}, with the greatest proportional increase seen in total physician costs. Conclusion: Using population projections and the ADSS provides useful insights into how population aging, rising incidence and decreasing mortality rates will increase the diabetes burden in Alberta.}

      \field{abstract}{Higher health care prices in the United States are a key reason that the nation's health spending is so much higher than that of other countries. Our study compared physicians' fees paid by public and private payers for primary care office visits and hip replacements in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We also compared physicians' incomes net of practice expenses, differences in financing the cost of medical education, and the relative contribution of payments per physician and of physician supply in the countries' national spending on physician services. Public and private payers paid somewhat higher fees to US primary care physicians for office visits (27 percent more for public, 70 percent more for private) and much higher fees to orthopedic physicians for hip replacements (70 percent more for public, 120 percent more for private) than public and private payers paid these physicians' counterparts in other countries. US primary care and orthopedic physicians also earned higher incomes ({\$}186,582 and {\$}442,450, respectively) than their foreign counterparts. We conclude that the higher fees, rather than factors such as higher practice costs, volume of services, or tuition expenses, were the main drivers of higher US spending, particularly in orthopedics.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Racial and ethnic differences in diabetes care and health care use and costs.}}
      \field{abstract}{INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown racial and ethnic differences in diabetes complication rates and diabetes control. The objective of this study was to examine racial and ethnic differences in diabetes care and health care use and costs for adults with diabetes using a nationally representative sample of the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and its related Diabetes Care Survey. The respondents were adults (aged 18 years and older) with diabetes, including non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic African Americans, and Hispanics. Racial and ethnic differences were examined in diabetes process of care and health care use and costs using logistic regression, negative binomial regression, and ordinary least squares regression with log cost. RESULTS: Most of the outcomes in diabetes care management, treatment, and complications were not significantly different among race groups. After adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, Hispanics were more likely to have eye problems than whites (odds ratio, 1.56; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.03-2.56). African Americans and Hispanics had lower total health care costs, lower ambulatory care costs, and lower prescription drug costs than whites (P {\textless} .01 for all). CONCLUSION: We found differences in ambulatory care and prescription drug fills among white, African American, and Hispanic adults with diabetes. However, most of the diabetes care measures were not significantly different among the three racial and ethnic groups. Understanding the reason outcomes do not differ when health care use and costs differ significantly should be a focus of future studies.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The influence of chronic health problems on work ability and productivity at work: a longitudinal study among older employees.}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the influence of chronic health problems on work ability and productivity at work among older employees using different methodological approaches in the analysis of longitudinal studies. METHODS: Data from employees, aged 45-64, of the longitudinal Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation was used (N=8411). Using three annual online questionnaires, we assessed the presence of seven chronic health problems, work ability (scale 0-10), and productivity at work (scale 0-10). Three linear regression generalized estimating equations were used. The time-lag model analyzed the relation of health problems with work ability and productivity at work after one year; the autoregressive model adjusted for work ability and productivity in the preceding year; and the third model assessed the relation of incidence and recovery with changes in work ability and productivity at work within the same year. RESULTS: Workers with health problems had lower work ability at one-year follow-up than workers without these health problems, varying from a 2.0{\%} reduction with diabetes mellitus to a 9.5{\%} reduction with psychological health problems relative to the overall mean (time-lag). Work ability of persons with health problems decreased slightly more during one-year follow-up than that of persons without these health problems, ranging from 1.4{\%} with circulatory to 5.9{\%} with psychological health problems (autoregressive). Incidence related to larger decreases in work ability, from 0.6{\%} with diabetes mellitus to 19.0{\%} with psychological health problems, than recovery related to changes in work ability, from a 1.8{\%} decrease with circulatory to an 8.5{\%} increase with psychological health problems (incidence-recovery). Only workers with musculoskeletal and psychological health problems had lower productivity at work at one-year follow-up than workers without those health problems (1.2{\%} and 5.6{\%}, respectively, time-lag). CONCLUSIONS: All methodological approaches indicated that chronic health problems were associated with decreased work ability and, to a much lesser extent, lower productivity at work. The choice for a particular methodological approach considerably influenced the strength of the associations, with the incidence of health problems resulting in the largest decreases in work ability and productivity at work.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Costs of Diabetes and Its Complications in Poland.}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem with severe complications and a significant impact on quality of life. It constitutes an enormous burden of disease due to high prevalence, severe co-morbidities and high costs for society. This study is the first comprehensive study on the direct and indirect costs of DM (type 1 and type 2) and associated complications in Poland. METHODS: In order to estimate the direct medical costs of DM and its complications, including the costs of medical consultation, hospitalisation, rehabilitation, drugs and medical equipment, data from the National Health Fund were used. Indirect costs on loss of productivity due to diabetes and its complications were based on data obtained from the ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) and from GUS (Poland's Central Statistical Office). Attributable risk methodology was used to assess the burden of DM complications. RESULTS: A continuous increase of the direct costs of diabetes has been observed since the year 2005. In the analysed time period (2005-2009) the direct costs of medical services for both types of DM doubled. DM is a cause of significant sickness absence and incapacity for work and therefore is associated with a growing productivity decline in Poland. The highest direct costs and indirect costs are associated with treatment of diabetes-related complications. Direct costs of hospital complication treatment were EUR 332 million, which exceeded by more than five times the direct costs of hospital treatment of diabetes per se, which in the same year amounted to EUR 58.5 million. The indirect costs of diabetes-related complications were higher by 41{\%} compared with indirect costs related to DM itself. Total costs of health care services for DM and its complications amounted to EUR 654 million, which constitutes a 2.8{\%} of total health care costs in Poland. Total DM cost in Poland in 2009 amounted EURO 1.5 billion. CONCLUSIONS: DM is causing a growing economic burden on the health care system and on Polish society in terms of health care and productivity losses. Most of the total cost of diabetes are indirect costs caused by productivity losses. Both direct and indirect costs are driven by the cost of diabetes complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Predicting factors associated with costs of diabetic patients in Taiwan}}
      \field{abstract}{This study examined healthcare costs for medication-using diabetic patients in Taiwan and predicted which factors were associated with costs. We analyzed claims data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Taiwan from 1998 to 1999. The approach included estimates of costs attributable to diabetes, diabetes-related complications, comorbidity incurred by diabetic patients. A multiple regression model was used to assess the contribution of patients' characteristics in 1998 on outpatient, inpatient, and total costs in 1998 and 1999. The prevalence of medication-using patients with diabetes was 2.6{\%} in 1998 and 2.8{\%} in 1999. Costs of healthcare were 13.3{\%} of total costs of NHI in 1998 versus 13.0{\%} in 1999. Health services delivered near the end of life consumed large portions of medical dollars. The three most prevalent clinical associations of diabetes were congestive heart failure, neuropathy, and ischemic heart disease. Adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics in 1998, this model could explain 8.0, 9.3, and 12.5{\%}, respectively, of the cost variation in outpatient, inpatient, and total costs in 1999. 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

      \field{labeltitle}{{Large impact of antidiabetic drug treatment and hospitalizations on economic burden of diabetes mellitus in The Netherlands during 2000 to 2004.}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications in The Netherlands. METHODS: The PHARMO Record Linkage System comprised among others linked drug dispensing, hospital and clinical laboratory data from approximately 2.5 million individuals in The Netherlands. Patients with DM (type 1 and type 2) were included in the study cohort from 2000 to 2004 if they used antidiabetic drugs or had HbA1c {\textgreater}or= 6.5 mmol/L or had a hospitalization for DM or a diabetic complication in the measurement year or in the preceding year. Controls, defined as subjects without a diagnosis of DM and/or subjects not prescribed glucose-lowering medication, were 1:1 matched to patients with diabetes, on birth year, zip code, and gender. Complications (hospitalizations and dispensings for cardiovascular disease/eye problems/amputations) were classified into stages. Complications attributed to DM were estimated as complication stages 1 and 2 among patients minus those among controls. Drug costs were extrapolated to The Netherlands by direct standardization. RESULTS: Among the total population in The Netherlands, the prevalence of DM increased from 2.8{\%} in 2000 to 4.0{\%} in 2004. Severe cardiovascular complications attributed to DM increased from 18,000 to 39,000 patients. Per DM patient the cost of direct treatment attributed to DM increased from Euro 974 in 2000 to Euro 1283 in 2004. Per 100 members of the total population, this increase was from Euro 2764 in 2000 to Euro 5140 in 2004. Most of these costs (65{\%} in 2004) were because of hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Drug treatment, hospitalizations, and cost attributed to diabetes mellitus have almost doubled between 2000 and 2004, but so did the "background" costs in the general population, perhaps because of preventive efforts.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Health-care expenditure and health policy in the USA versus other high-spending OECD countries.}}
      \field{abstract}{The USA has exceptional levels of health-care expenditure, but growth has slowed dramatically in recent years, amidst major efforts to close the coverage gap with other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We reviewed expenditure trends and key policies since 2000 in the USA and five other high-spending OECD countries. Higher health-sector prices explain much of the difference between the USA and other high-spending countries, and price dynamics are largely responsible for the slowdown in expenditure growth. Other high-spending countries did not face the same coverage challenges, and could draw from a broader set of policies to keep expenditure under control, but expenditure growth was similar to the USA. Tightening Medicare and Medicaid price controls on plans and providers, and leveraging the scale of the public programmes to increase efficiency in financing and care delivery, might prevent a future economic recovery from offsetting the slowdown in health sector prices and expenditure growth.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The costs of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Italy: A CODE-2 sub-study}}
      \field{abstract}{Aim: To estimate the direct, indirect, and intangible costs associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Italy in 1998. To evaluate the economic impact of diabetic complications, and to investigate drug treatment patterns and associated costs in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The Italian arm of an international study (COsts of Diabetes in Europe - Type 2 [CODE-2], a descriptive, cross-sectional survey) was set up to collect information retrospectively by means of questionnaires from a sample of 1263 patients. Resource use was measured in monetary terms using a set of costs and tariffs. Intangible costs were estimated using the EuroQol questionnaire. Results: The average yearly cost for medical resources for a patient with type 2 diabetes was 2991 Euro, whereas the estimated cost for the whole population with type 2 diabetes was about 5170 million Euro. This corresponds to 6.65{\%} of the total healthcare expenditure (public and private) in Italy. Of direct costs, 29{\%} was spent for the treatment of diabetes and 39{\%} for the treatment of diabetic complications; while the remaining 32{\%} was spent for healthcare not related to diabetes. Quality of life score in patients with type 2 diabetes (EuroQoL overall average score) was 0.68. Conclusions: Type 2 diabetes has a high cost to society. The major cost component is due to the care of diabetic complications, not to the treatment of the illness itself; in particular, drug costs represent a relatively small proportion of such treatment cost.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE - The purpose of this study was to calculate the total number of inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient clinic visits, and total direct health care costs associated with veterans with diabetes receiving care in Veterans Administration (VA) facilities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The number of inpatient hospitalizations is tracked for years 1994-1998, and outpatient clinic visits are tracked for years 1997 and 1998. Trends in utilization across different age and racial groups, as well as total direct inpatient and outpatient costs for 1998, are presented. RESULTS - Between 1994 and 1998, hospitalization rates decreased from 1.68 to 1.61. The average number of outpatient visits was 4.5 in 1997 and 4.6 in 1998. VA incurred {\$}214.8 million in outpatient expenditures and {\$}1.45 billion in inpatient expenditures for veterans with diabetes receiving VA care. CONCLUSIONS - Health care delivery systems and payors track the cost and utilization of services by specific patient groups to support disease management, quality improvement, external reporting, and cost containment. Tracking the utilization and cost of diabetes care is necessary to understand the financial impact of diabetes on health care systems and the overall burden of diabetes on individuals.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The direct economic cost of pharmacologically-treated diabetes in Italy-2006. The ARNO observatory.}}
      \field{abstract}{To estimate the prevalence and the direct cost of pharmacologically-treated diabetes in Italy. METHODS: The ARNO observatory database, containing the 20-year medical prescriptions of over 10 million Italian people, was used. Ten-year longitudinal data were available in 22 Local Health Districts (LHD). Subjects were classified as having diabetes when prescribed glucose-lowering drugs (oral agents or insulin) (311,979 individuals in 2006). The direct cost was calculated as the sum of drug use, financial compensation by LHD for the inpatient (hospital DRG) and outpatient activities (consultations, laboratory tests, radiology, etc.), all regulated by government contracts. Individuals with diabetes were compared with pharmacologically-treated subjects without diabetes, pair-matched for age, sex and general practitioner. RESULTS: In the 10-year period, the prevalence of pharmacologically-treated diabetes increased from 3.08{\%} to 4.45{\%} (P for trend, {\textless}0.001). The average pro capita cost totaled €2,589 in 2006 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 2,584-2,594), corresponding to a rate ratio vs. no-diabetes of 1.54 (95{\%} CI, 1.50-1.56). The cost of drugs was € 827 (rate ratio, 1.80 vs. no-diabetes; 95{\%} CI, 1.79-1.82), that of service use, € 488 (rate ratio, 1.07 (0.93-1.25). Only 20{\%} of the pharmaceutical cost was due to glucose-lowering drugs, a percentage stable through the years. The cost of any hospital admission, as defined by DRGs, was independent of diabetes, but the overall cost was much higher in diabetes due to much higher admission rates. Cardiovascular complications and renal failure accounted for the large majority of excess hospital cost. CONCLUSION: The direct economic burden of pharmacologically-treated diabetes on the National Health System is very high, due to the growing prevalence of disease and the cost of complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Epidemiology of complications and total treatment costs from diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in Germany (ROSSO 4)}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To determine the occurrence of complications and treatment costs in the first 6 years from diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in the primary care level. DESIGN The German multi-centre, retrospective epidemiological cohort study ROSSO observed patients from diagnosis in 1995-1999 until the end of 2003 or loss to follow-up. SETTING 192 randomly contacted primary care practices and all patient records of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. PARTICIPANTS All 3,142 patients insured in a public health insurance plan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Diabetes-related complications were documented from patient files. Treatment costs were attributed using the doctor's tariff, hospital DRGs and medication price lists for Germany. RESULTS At diagnosis, already 22.4{\%} of patients presented with CHD, 15.4{\%} with CHF, 5.8{\%} with pAOD, 3.1{\%} with stroke and 3.9{\%} with AMI, but less than 0.5{\%} with documented microvascular complications. 7.4{\%} of patients were diagnosed with prior depression and, 5.0{\%} with polyneuropathy. Within a mean of 6.5 years of follow-up 114 patients (3.6{\%}) died. The cumulated occurrence of AMI and stroke rose without a lag phase almost linearly from diagnosis reaching 6.7{\%} for AMI and 7.7{\%} for stroke. The total number of strokes was significantly higher than AMI (181 strokes vs. 109 AMI; p{\textless}/=0.001). As expected, the rate of microvascular complications was low during this early disease stage but nevertheless reached 2.8 {\%} of patients (amputation, dialysis and blindness combined). Mortality and stroke rates did not differ significantly between sexes but men suffered more frequently from AMI (4.8{\%} men, 2.2{\%} women; p {\textless} 0.001). Total costs of diabetes care was 1,288 euro (1,610 {\$})for the first treatment year with diagnosed diabetes and rose to 3,845 euro (4,806 {\$}) in year seven. Costs for treating complications dominated already in the first year after diagnosis. The mean direct treatment costs amounted to 3,210 euro (4,013 {\$}) per patient and year for the first 6.5 years. CONCLUSION ROSSO is the first epidemiological cohort study examining longitudinal epidemiological data of the same patients over more than five years (up to eight years) for type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary care practices, starting from diagnosis. The rate of complications rose linearly from diagnosis without a lag phase. Stroke occurred more often than myocardial infarction, the latter more often in men. Total treatment costs were dominated by costs of treating complications from early on, suggesting a costs saving potential by early detection of diabetes as well as by secondary prevention and patient empowerment in the period following diagnosis.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Assessment of the direct medical costs of diabetes mellitus and its complications in the United Arab Emirates}}
      \field{abstract}{Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is well recognized as a major and increasing burden to the country's resources due to its severe, long term debilitating effects on individuals, families and the society at large. The aim of the study was to estimate the direct annual treatment costs of DM and its related complications among patients in Al-Ain city, UAE. A sample of 150 DM patients were enrolled during 2004-2005, and their medical costs over the ensuing 12 months was measured, quantified, analyzed and extrapolated to the population in Al-Ain and UAE, using conventional and inference statistics. The costs were converted from UAE Dirhams to US Dollar, using the official conversion rate of US{\$} (1 USD = 3.68 AED). The total annual direct treatment costs of DM among patients without complications in Al Ain-UAE, was US {\$}1,605 (SD = 1,206) which is 3.2 times higher than the per capita expenditure for health care in the UAE (US{\$} 497) during 2004 (WHO, 2004). However, this cost increased 2.2 times with the presence of DM related complications for patients with microvascular complications, by 6.4 times for patients with macrovascular complications and 9.4 times for patients with both micro and macrovascular complications. Likewise, the annual direct hospitalization costs of DM patients increased by 3.7 times for patients with microvascular complications, by 6.6 times for patients with macrovascular complications and by 5 times for patients with both micro and macrovascualr complications. Overall, costs increased with age, diabetes duration and were higher for patients treated with insulin compared to those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or with diet control only. DM direct treatment costs increased with the presence and progression of chronic DM related complications. Hospitalisation costs constituted a large proportion and were increasingly higher with the presence and progression of DM related complications. To reduce the impact on healthcare resources, efforts should be made to prevent progression to DM complications, by implementing guidelines for diabetes care, screening for complications and better management.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To estimate the cost of providing health care to patients with type 2 diabetes, by differentiating costs of the disease, costs of complications, and other unrelated health costs. METHODS Data on resource use were retrospectively collected from medical records and personal interviews in 29 primary health care centers in Spain. Patients were randomly selected from each center's diabetes registry. RESULTS We evaluated 1004 patients (561 women) with a mean age of 67.42 years and a mean disease duration of 10.07 years. A total of 50.9{\%} had no complications, 17.7{\%} had macrovascular complications only, 19.5{\%} had microvascular complications only and 11.9{\%} presented both types of complication. The annual health cost per patient was 1305.15 euros. Of this cost, 28.6{\%} (373.27 euros) was directly related to diabetes control, 30.51{\%} (398.20 euros) was related to complications of the disease, and 40.89{\%} (533.68 euros) was unrelated. The mean cost of patients with no complications was 883 euros compared with 1403 euros for those with microvascular complications, 2022 euros for those with macrovascular complications and 2133 euros for patients with both types of complication. CONCLUSIONS Because of the high cost of treating type 2 diabetes and its complications, preventive measures should be implemented and control of the disease should be improved to reduce the costs associated with chronic complications.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper estimates the effect of diabetes on labor-force participation, hours worked, days-out-of-work due to illness, and earnings using data from the National Health Interview Survey. Findings indicate that diabetes, estimated wholly, is significantly detrimental to most labor market outcomes. However, separation of type I and II diabetes shows that much of the negative effect is due to type II diabetes. On average a female with type II diabetes can experience a wage penalty of almost 50{\%} relative to a healthy individual. Additionally, estimates of specifically type II diabetes may be subject to endogeneity bias. To account for this, I utilize whether an individual's biological mother has been diagnosed with diabetes as an instrumental variable. This instrument provides both theoretical and statistical explanatory power to separate the causal effect of type II diabetes on labor-force decisions.}

      \field{abstract}{Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, the current study examines the effect of type I and type II diabetes on employment status and wages. The results suggest that both the probability of employment and wages are negatively related to the number of years since the initial diagnosis of diabetes. Moreover, the effect of diabetes duration on the probability of employment appears to be nonlinear, peaking around 16 years for females and 10 years for males. A similar negative effect on wages is found only in male diabetics. Finally, the results suggest that failure to distinguish between type I and type II diabetics may lead to some counterintuitive results.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Major complications have an impact on total annual medical cost of diabetes: results of a database analysis}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common, chronic, and costly disease, and its prevalence is increasing in major industrialized countries. Diabetes has indeed a high social impact mainly because of its chronic complications. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to analyze the direct medical costs attributable to Type 2 diabetes mellitus and its determinants, as assessed in a diabetologic center (DC) in Italy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cost of care study; Type 2 diabetic patients who visited between January 2001 and August 2002 were randomly selected from the database of the DC of Portogruaro. Cost data collected included hospitalizations, visits, diagnostics, and pharmacological therapies and were quantified and analyzed in the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). RESULTS Two hundred ninety-nine diabetic patients were extracted, with a mean/patient follow up of 476 days. Mean age was 67.5 years and males represented 67.2{\%} of the sample. The average annual health care cost was found to be euro1909.67 per patient; pharmacological therapies accounted for the greatest proportion of direct medical costs (52{\%}), followed by hospitalization (28{\%}) and diagnostic exams (11{\%}). Annual costs increased with the number of diabetes related comorbidities, from euro1039 to 3141 per patient in participants with none or more than two complications, respectively. CONCLUSION Long-term complications carry a considerable impact on total annual medical cost. Our study demonstrates that an increase in the number of comorbidities is directly associated with an increase of Type 2 diabetes cost. Strategies aimed at preventing the onset of diabetic complications are likely to reduce medical costs in the long run, while improving patients' health.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Productivity Losses Associated With Diabetes in the U.S.}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE - The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of productivity losses in the U.S. attributable to diabetes, with regard to specific demographic and disease-related characteristics in the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We used the 1989 National Health Interview Survey, a random survey of individuals in the U.S. that included a diabetes supplement. Data on individuals were obtained for labor force participation, hours of work, demographic and occupational characteristics, self-reported health status, and several variables that indicated the presence, duration, and severity (complications) of diabetes. Using multivariate regression analyses, we estimated the association of independent variables (e.g., demographics, health, and diabetes status) with labor force participation, hours of work lost, and the economic value of lost work attributable to diabetes and its complications and duration. RESULTS - In general, the presence of diabetes and complications were found to be related to workforce participation variables. The magnitude of the lost-productivity costs depended on personal characteristics and on the presence and status of diabetes. In general, the loss of yearly earnings amounted to about a one-third reduction in earnings and ranged from {\$}3,700 to {\$}8,700 per annum. CONCLUSIONS - Diabetes has a considerable net effect on earnings, and the complications and duration of diabetes have compound effects. Our findings have implications for the cost-effectiveness of diabetes control; the presence of complicating factors is the single most important predictive factor in lost productivity costs attributable to diabetes, and thus the avoidance or retardation of complications will have an impact on indirect health-related costs.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The cost of treating type 2 diabetes (CODEIRE)}}
      \field{abstract}{Diabetes mellitus is the most common chronic metabolic disease and a major source of morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is by far the most prevalent form of diabetes accounting for around 90{\%} of cases worldwide. In recent years it has become apparent that a diabetes epidemic is unfolding as a result of increasing obesity, sedentary lifestyles and an ageing population. The enormity of the diabetes epidemic raises concern about the total cost to healthcare systems. This study was undertaken to investigate the direct healthcare costs of managing T2D in Ireland. Data was captured on 701 diabetes patients attending four diabetes centres. A bottom-up, prevalence-based design was used, which collected data on hospital resource use and clinical outcome measures over a 12-month period (1999/2000). The study was observational in nature, focusing on usual care of patients with T2D. Although the true prevalence of T2D in Ireland is unknown, conservative estimates are 3.9{\%} for diagnosed diabetes and 6{\%} for both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Using these figures the annual total direct cost was estimated at 377.2 million euro for diagnosed diabetes and 580.2 million euro for both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. This corresponds to 4.1{\%} and 6.4{\%} of total healthcare expenditure respectively. Hospitalisations were the main driver of costs, accounting for almost half of overall costs, while ambulatory and drug costs accounted for 27{\%} and 25{\%} respectively. Hospitalisation costs were high because 60{\%} of patients had developed complications. The most common microvascular and macrovascular complications were neuropathy and angina respectively. The annual cost of care for patients with microvascular and macrovascular complications were 1.8 and 2.9 times the cost of treating those without clinical evidence of complications respectively. The figure for patients with both types of complications was 3.8. This study shows that T2D is a very costly disease, largely due to the cost of and the management of complications. Many diabetes related complications are preventable, therefore it would appear a cost-effective approach for government to invest in the prevention of T2D and diabetes related complications.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Cost of illness of adult diabetes mellitus underestimated if comorbidity is not considered}}
      \field{abstract}{Objective. To determine costs of illness for adult diabetes mellitus (DM), including complications caused by DM. Design. A population-based multicentre cross-sectional study including an interview and a physical examination of patients identified as having DM. The patients' medical records were analysed regarding diagnoses and complications attributable to DM. Setting. Eight health care centres of six primary care districts in Southern Sweden. Subjects. 1677 adults aged 25+, cared for at the health care centres, entered the study. Main outcome measures. Utilization of health care and care from relatives and the municipality, absence of short- and long-term sickness, cost of illness. Results. The average annual direct and indirect costs for an adult with DM were calculated to be 61 700 Swedish Kronor (SEK) or 2.5 times higher than earlier estimates. The incremental cost of DM was 34 100 SEK. The cost distribution was 28{\%} for health care, 31{\%} for the municipality and relatives and 41{\%} lost productivity. Conclusions. Calculations for the cost of illness of DM are underestimated if comorbidity caused by DM is not considered. When DM-related complications are included to identify the actual burden of disease to society, the cost of illness as a result of DM in Sweden is substantially higher than previously estimated.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The costs of treating American Indian adults with diabetes within the Indian Health Service}}
      \field{abstract}{We examined the costs of treating American Indian adults with diabetes within the Indian Health Service (IHS). We extracted demographic and health service utilization data from the IHS electronic medical reporting system for 32 052 American Indian adults in central Arizona in 2004 and 2005. We derived treatment cost estimates from an IHS facility-specific cost report. We examined chronic condition prevalence, medical service utilization, and treatment costs for American Indians with and without diabetes. IHS treatment costs for the 10.9{\%} of American Indian adults with diabetes accounted for 37.0{\%} of all adult treatment costs. Persons with diabetes accounted for nearly half of all hospital days (excluding days for obstetrical care). Hospital inpatient service costs for those with diabetes accounted for 32.2{\%} of all costs. In this first study of treatment costs within the IHS, costs for American Indians with diabetes were found to consume a significant proportion of IHS resources. The findings give federal agencies and tribes critical information for resource allocation and policy formulation to reduce and eventually eliminate diabetes-related disparities between American Indians and Alaska Natives and other racial/ethnic populations.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to project the prevalence and cost of diabetes mellitus in Canada and its provinces for the years 2000 to 2016. METHOD: The total costs per capita, including hospitalizations, day procedures, physician services, prescription drugs and estimated outpatient dialysis services, for individuals with diabetes were measured using 1996 administrative data from Saskatchewan Health, Saskatchewan, Canada, and organized within 5-year age groups. The general population projection was based on the Statistics Canada provincial median population projections from 2000 to 2016. Diabetes incidence, prevalence and mortality projections for this time period were obtained from previous projection estimates for Manitoba, Canada. RESULTS: The number of individuals with diabetes in the general population in Canada will increase from approximately 1.4 milhon patients in 2000 to 2.4 million patients in 2016. The total healthcare costs are projected to increase from Can {\$}4.66 billion in 2000 to S8.14 billion in 2016 (1996 dollar values). Important differences in diabetes-related cost trends were noted across provinces and territories. CONCLUSION: The projection model used in this study showed that if the increase in the prevalence of diabetes follows current trends, healthcare costs for people with diabetes in Canada will increase by 75{\%} between 2000 and 2016.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Direct health care costs of diabetic patients in Spain}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to estimate the health care resources spent by type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients in Spain during the year 2002. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This is a cost-of-illness study focusing on direct health care costs estimated from primary and secondary sources of information. A prevalence of diabetes ranging from 5 to 6{\%} of the adult population was determined. Total cost is composed of six items: insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents, other drugs, disposable and consumable goods (glucose test strips, needles, and syringes), hospitalization, primary care visits, and visits to endocrinologists and dialysis. RESULTS The estimated direct cost of diabetes in 2002 ranges from 2.4 to 2.67 billion euro. Hospital costs were the most (933 million euro), followed by noninsulin, nonhypoglycemic agent drugs (777-932 million euro). Much lower are the costs of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents (311 million euro), primary care visits (181-272 million euro), specialized visits (127-145 million euro), and disposable elements (70-81 million euro). Expenditures for all drugs and consumable goods ranged between 1.16 and 1.3 billion euro, representing 48-49{\%} of total cost, which is 15{\%} higher than hospital costs. CONCLUSIONS The direct health care costs of diabetic patients are high (6.3-7.4{\%} of total National Health System expenditure). Their average annual cost is 1,290-1,476 euro. For individuals without diabetes, the average annual cost is 865 euro.}
      \field{annotation}{it is not clear what approach is used. IT seems that they have used a mix of total healthcare costs for diabetes and attributable costs, but the distingtion is hard to do. Therefore I would exclude it, but talk about it with Marc.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE To examine medical and mental health care expenditures for large numbers of individuals with diabetes enrolled in employment-sponsored insurance plans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Health insurance billing data for approximately 1.3 million individuals enrolled in health insurance plans sponsored by 862 large self-insured employers nationwide were used to examine employer expenditures and consumer out-of-pocket payments for 20,937 people identified with diabetes. These expenditures were compared with expenditures for individuals with other chronic illnesses. Main outcome measures were covered charges, insurance plan reimbursements, and estimated consumer out-of-pocket payments for both medical and mental health services. RESULTS A total of 1.7{\%} of enrollees were identified as having diabetes and approximately 11{\%} of those used at least one mental health service during 1996. Health care expenditures were three times higher for those with diabetes compared with all health care consumers in these insurance plans, but when compared with individuals with other chronic illnesses such as heart disease, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and asthma, those with diabetes were not more expensive for employers' insurance plans. Diabetes accounts for 6.5{\%} of total health plan expenditures. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes is not more expensive for either consumers or their employer-sponsored insurance plans than other chronic illnesses.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Health Care Costs and Mortality for Canadian Urban and Rural Patients with Diabetes: Population-Based Trends from 1993-2001}}
      \field{abstract}{Background: Recent reports suggest that the health status of individuals residing in rural areas (as much as one third of the Canadian population) may be inferior to those who live in urban areas. Objective: This study compared trends in mortality and in provincial health care system costs for individuals with diabetes, according to urban/rural residence in Saskatchewan, Canada. Methods: The Canadian National Diabetes Surveillance System criteria were applied to the linked administrative databases of Saskatchewan Health to identify all individuals with diabetes between 1991 and 2001. Annual health care costs across 5 categories of health care services (physician visits, prescription medications, hospitalizations, day surgeries, and dialysis) were identified over a 9-year period (1993-2001). Costs (in 2001 Can {\$}) and mortality rates were directly age adjusted, and comparisons were made across individuals residing in large urban, small urban, and rural areas. Results: A total of 57,774 individuals with diabetes were identified, approximately half (n = 26,656) of whom resided in rural areas. In 2001, total per capita costs were {\$}3454 for large urban, {\$}3427 for small urban, and {\$}3289 for rural dwellers. Per capita costs of most individual categories were highest in large urban centers over the follow-up period with the exception of hospitalizations, which were highest among rural residents ({\$}1444 vs {\$}1283 for large urban residents). Despite differences in the individual cost categories, overall health care costs according to place of residence were similar. Overall, the age-adjusted mortality rates increased substantially from 12 (1993) to 18 (2001) deaths per 1000 population, although rates were similar across geographic locations. Conclusions: From 1993 to 2001, we observed systematic differences in costs of individual resource categories according to urban/rural residence in Saskatchewan, with urban dwellers with diabetes incurring greater costs in most categories. Age-adjusted total costs and mortality rates were similar, however, suggesting that rural populations with diabetes may not be as disadvantaged as commonly believed. Investing in better primary care access for all patients with diabetes may reduce downstream costs in Saskatchewan's provincial health care system. 2007 Excerpta Medica, Inc.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Increasing expenditure on health care incurred by diabetic subjects in a developing country: a study from India}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the direct cost incurred by diabetic subjects who were in different income groups in urban and rural India, as well as to examine the changing trends of costs in the urban setting from 1998 to 2005. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 556 diabetic subjects from various urban and rural regions of seven Indian states were enrolled. A brief uniform coded questionnaire (24 items) on direct cost was used. RESULTS Annual family income was higher in urban subjects (rupees [Rs] 100,000 or {\$}2,273) than in the rural subjects (Rs 36,000 or {\$}818) (P {\textless} 0.001). Total median expenditure on health care was Rs 10,000 ({\$}227) in urban and Rs 6,260 ({\$}142) in rural (P {\textless} 0.001) subjects. Treatment costs increased with duration of diabetes, presence of complications, hospitalization, surgery, insulin therapy, and urban setting. Lower-income groups spent a higher proportion of their income on diabetes care (urban poor 34{\%} and rural poor 27{\%}). After accounting for inflation, a secular increase of 113{\%} was observed in the total expenses between 1998 and 2005 in the urban population. The highest increase in percentage of household income devoted to diabetes care was in the lowest economic group (34{\%} of income in 1998 vs. 24.5{\%} in 2005) (P {\textless} 0.01). There was a significant improvement in urban subjects in medical reimbursement from 2{\%} (1998) to 21.3{\%} (2005). CONCLUSIONS Urban and rural diabetic subjects spend a large percentage of income on diabetes management. The economic burden on urban families in developing countries is rising, and the total direct cost has doubled from 1998 to 2005.}

Medical costs were analysed using multivariate linear regression. Estimates of costs seen in The Netherlands were based on these results plus information from other sources regarding costs of end-stage renal disease, appliances, travel and productivity loss. RESULTS Although only 9{\%} of patients were hospitalized within the previous 6 months, hospitalization costs represented one-third of the medical costs, drug costs 40{\%} and ambulatory costs 26{\%}. Patients using insulin, patients with macrovascular complications only or in combination with microvascular complications incurred higher medical costs than other patients. Age and hyperlipidaemia were also positively related to medical costs. When these results were combined with other data sources, we estimated that patients with Type 2 diabetes are responsible for pound365 500 000 (1 271 000 000 guilders) or 3.4{\%} of the relevant parts of health care costs in 1998. The non-medical costs (travel costs, productivity costs) are limited: 52 500 000 (183 000 000 guilders). CONCLUSIONS Independent determinants of the medical costs of Type 2 diabetes in The Netherlands include age, complications, insulin use and hyperlipidaemia.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The prevalence and cost of diabetes in metropolitan France: What trends between 1998 and 2000?}}
      \field{abstract}{Objectives: Our aim was to update available data concerning the prevalence and cost of diabetes in metropolitan France. Methods: We performed a retrospective study using patient reimbursement data from all the 128 local health offices (CPAM) in metropolitan France. We selected patients who received reimbursements for an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. Thus, 704,423 patients were studied by using 1998 data and 1,145,603 patients were studied by using data from 2000. The expenditures studied represented the total amount reimbursed by national health insurance to diabetic patients. The cost differential which could be attributed to diabetes was calculated by determining the difference between costs generated by diabetic patients to those generated by the rest of the population of the same age. Results: Between 1998 and 2000, the prevalence of diabetes treated in the population of affiliates covered by the general scheme increased from 2.78{\%} to 2.96{\%}. The total amount paid by the general scheme for care to diabetic patients (related to diabetes or not) was 5.710 billion euros in 2000 compared to 4.862 billion euros in 1998. The amount which can be attributed to diabetes alone can be estimated to be 2.414 billion euros in 2000 compared to 2.021 billion euros in 1998. After considering the impact of the increase in the number of treated diabetics, a modification in the modalities of medical care probably accounts for 183 million euros of the cost increase. Medical equipment (self blood glucose monitoring devices, reagent strips, finger lancets....) accounts for 39.3{\%} (72 million euros) of this cost differential, medications account for 34.4{\%} (63 million euros) and nursing care 16.9{\%} (31 million euros). There was no change in the cost of diabetes with relation to expenses for medical consultations.}

      \field{abstract}{AIMS To examine medical resource use of Swedish patients with type 2 diabetes during 2000-2004 and to estimate annual costs of care. METHODS Retrospective population-based cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes identified in computerised medical records at 26 primary care centres in Uppsala county, Sweden. Annual quantities of medical resources were determined for prevalent cases during 2000-2004 using register data from outpatient primary care, outpatient hospital care, the National Inpatient Register and a national register for treatment of uraemia. Average costs of care of patients with type 2 diabetes were estimated based on year 2004 resource quantities of 8230 prevalent study cases. RESULTS Annual quantities of medical resource use were stable in outpatient primary care and outpatient hospital care, with patients making an average of two General Practitioner visits and 3.5 outpatient hospital visits each year. Higher rates of hospitalisation [12{\%} in 2000 (n = 6711) compared with 16{\%} in 2004 (n = 8230)] led to an increase in the mean (SD) number of inpatient days from 2.3 (11.8) to 2.7 (11.9) (p = 0.040) between 2000 and 2004. Mean (SD) total costs of care in 2004 were EUR 3602 (EUR 9537). Inpatient care was the major contributor to costs, accounting for 57{\%} of total costs while drug costs accounted for an average 7{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Swedish type 2 diabetic patients in this large sample from Uppsala county required steady annual amounts of outpatient care and increasing amounts of inpatient care during 2000-2004. The associated costs in 2004 were substantial, with inpatient care identified as the most important component.}

      \field{abstract}{AIMS The number of prescription medications and out-of-pocket expenses of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were evaluated to assess the economic burden of diabetes. METHODS The self-reported number of prescription medications and out-of-pocket healthcare expenses were evaluated from respondents of the United States SHIELD study with and without a diagnosis of T2DM. Medications included monotherapy and combination therapy; combination tablets were counted as one agent. Analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, prescription insurance coverage, and household income. RESULTS Of the T2DM respondents (n=3551), 40{\%} were on 1 prescription antidiabetic agent (7{\%} insulin alone), 26{\%} were on 2 agents, 8{\%} were on {\textgreater}or=3 agents, with a mean of 1.3 antidiabetic agents. After adjusting for age, gender, insurance coverage, and income, respondents with T2DM had a significantly larger total number of prescriptions (6.2) and higher out-of-pocket expenses for both annual medical ({\$}1158) and mofonthly prescription ({\$}144) expenses, compared with respondents without T2DM (n=8686) (4.1 prescriptions, {\$}925 annual medical, {\$}118 monthly prescription) (p{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS Increased out-of-pocket medical and medication costs in T2DM are due to the use of both antidiabetic agents and other medications for treatment of comorbid conditions.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE Estimate the direct cost of medical care incurred by the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). METHODS The clinical files of 497 patients who were treated in secondary and tertiary medical care units in 2002-2004 were reviewed. Costs were quantified using a disease costing approach (DCA) from the provider's perspective, a micro-costing technique, and a bottom-up methodology. Average annual costs by diagnosis, complication, and total cost were estimated. RESULTS Total IMSS DM2 annual costs were US{\$}452 064 988, or 3.1{\%} of operating expenses. The annual average cost per patient was US{\$}3 193.75, with US{\$}2 740.34 per patient without complications and US{\$}3 550.17 per patient with complications. Hospitalization and intensive care bed-days generated the greatest expenses. CONCLUSIONS The high cost of providing medical care to patients with DM2 and its complications represents an economic burden that health institutions should consider in their budgets to enable them to offer quality service that is both adequate and timely. Using the micro-costing methodology allows an approximation to real data on utilization and management of the disease.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Direct medical costs of type 2 diabetes and its complications in Switzerland}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND This paper analyses the direct medical costs of type 2 diabetes and its complications in Switzerland. METHODS Individual healthcare resource consumption related to type 2 diabetes and its complications was determined retrospectively in 1479 non-incident and non-dying patients over 12 months (1998-1999). Literature-derived attributable risks were used to correct for non-diabetes related macrovascular disease. RESULTS A total of 111 primary care physicians from 19 cantons throughout Switzerland participated. Their diabetic patients on average had 10.3 consultations per year related to this disease (95{\%} CI: 10.0-10.7). Patients spent on average 2.7 days (95{\%} CI: 2.2-3.3) per year in hospital due to diabetes and diabetes-related complications. Mean annual type 2 diabetes-related direct medical costs per patient amounted to CHF 3,508 / Euro 2,323 (95{\%} CI: CHF 3,140-3,876 / Euro 2,080-2,567). They were particularly high in patients with insulin treatment or with complications. After application of attributable risks and a correction for the use of adjuvant materials, costs were CHF 3,324 / Euro 2,201. Assuming 250,000 patients with type 2 diabetes in Switzerland leads to an estimate of CHF 0.88 billion spent for this disease and its complications in 1998. This represents a share of about 2.2{\%} of the country's total healthcare expenditures. CONCLUSION These findings demonstrate the high economic importance of type 2 diabetes and its complications in Switzerland.}

      \field{abstract}{This study explores the impact of diabetes on employment in Mexico using data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) (2005), taking into account the possible endogeneity of diabetes via an instrumental variable estimation strategy. We find that diabetes significantly decreases employment probabilities for men by about 9.9 percent (p{\textless}0.01) and somewhat less so for women—4.2 percent (p{\textless}0.1)—without any indication of diabetes being endogenous. Further analysis shows that diabetes mainly affects the employment probabilities of people above the age of 44 and also has stronger effects on the poor than on the rich, particularly for men. Our results highlight — for the first time — the detrimental employment impact of diabetes in a developing country.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The cost of major comorbidity in people with diabetes mellitus}}
      \field{abstract}{Background: People with diabetes mellitus are more likely to have cardiovascular, renal and ophthalmic comorbidity than those without diabetes. Information on the economic impact of diabetes and its complications on the Canadian health care system is limited. Methods: To estimate health care expenditures for diabetes and its major complications, we identified people with diabetes in 1996 in Saskatchewan, using the administrative databases of Saskatchewan Health. We grouped utilization and expenditure data for prescription drugs, physician services, hospitalizations, day surgery procedures and dialysis services according to cardiovascular, renal and ophthalmic services, according to billing codes and the American Hospital Formulary Services classification for prescription drugs. Results: Of the 38 124 people identified (48.5{\%} female and 9.7{\%} registered Indians), 46.6{\%} had cardiovascular-related records, 19.8{\%} ophthalmic-related records and 6.6{\%} renal-related records. Registered Indians had significantly fewer (p {\textless} 0.001) cardiovascular-related records than the rest of the diabetic population (35.1{\%} v. 47.9{\%}, respectively) but more renal-related records (11.7{\%} v. 6.0{\%}, respectively). The total 1996 Saskatchewan Health expenditure for the study group, within the observed categories, was estimated to be {\$}134.3 million, of which {\$}35.5 million (26.4{\%}) was for cardiovascular-related services, {\$}10 million (7.5{\%}) for renal-related services and {\$}3.3 million (2.5{\%}) for ophthalmic-related services. Interpretation: In 1996, 36.4{\%} of health care expenditures for people with diabetes was attributable to major comorbidity. Actions to prevent or control such comorbidity will yield significant cost savings.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Diabetes, its treatment, and catastrophic medical spending in 35 developing countries.}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE: To assess the individual financial impact of having diabetes in developing countries, whether diabetic individuals possess appropriate medications, and the extent to which health insurance may protect diabetic individuals by increasing medication possession or decreasing the risk of catastrophic spending. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using 2002-2003 World Health Survey data (n = 121,051 individuals; 35 low- and middle-income countries), we examined possession of medications to treat diabetes and estimated the relationship between out-of-pocket medical spending (2005 international dollars), catastrophic medical spending, and diabetes. We assessed whether health insurance modified these relationships. RESULTS: Diabetic individuals experience differentially higher out-of-pocket medical spending, particularly among individuals with high levels of spending (excess spending of {\$}157 per year [95{\%} CI 130-184] at the 95th percentile), and a greater chance of incurring catastrophic medical spending (17.8 vs. 13.9{\%}; difference 3.9{\%} [95{\%} CI 0.2-7.7]) compared with otherwise similar individuals without diabetes. Diabetic individuals with insurance do not have significantly lower risks of catastrophic medical spending (18.6 vs. 17.7{\%}; difference not significant), nor were they significantly more likely to possess diabetes medications (22.8 vs. 20.6{\%}; difference not significant) than those who were otherwise similar but without insurance. These effects were more pronounced and significant in lower-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: In low-income countries, despite insurance, diabetic individuals are more likely to experience catastrophic medical spending and often do not possess appropriate medications to treat diabetes. Research into why policies in these countries may not adequately protect people from catastrophic spending or enhance possession of critical medications is urgently needed.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Explaining High Health Care Spending in the United States: An International Comparison of Supply, Utilization, Prices, and Quality The}}
      \field{abstract}{This analysis uses data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other sources to compare health care spending, supply, utilization, prices, and quality in 13 industrialized countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The U.S. spends far more on health care than any other country. However this high spending cannot be attributed to higher income, an older population, or greater supply or utilization of hospitals and doctors. Instead, the findings suggest the higher spending is more likely due to higher prices and perhaps more readily accessible technology and greater obesity. Health care quality in the U.S. varies and is not notably superior to the far less expensive systems in the other study countries. Of the countries studied, Japan has the lowest health spending, which it achieves primarily through aggressive price regulation.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Pharmacoeconomic Evaluation of Anti-Diabetic Therapy in A Nigerian Tertiary Health Institution}}
      \field{abstract}{Background: The major problem that prompted the study is scarcity of facts on actual cost of illness to the patient and society at large. Methods: It is a retrospective study and involved using 277 prescriptions from randomly selected 37 case notes of diabetic patients. In addition, stop watch time studies and standard cost accounting technique was employed. The hospital pharmacy costs of the drugs were used. Pieces of information such as demographic data prescribed drugs, fasting blood sugar level, blood pressure were abstracted from the case notes. The various cost components such as drug procurement, transport, personnel and diagnostic test costs over one year period were determined for each patient and added up. These were summed up to calculate the direct cost of illness for all the patients and the average determined. Results: No of patients studied = 37; No of patients on insulin= 4; No of patient on concurrent medication =32; Duration of diabetes (Range) = 4 months- 33 years (mean 8.1 years); Cost per-patient for those on insulin = N116, 026.79 ({\$}828.76); Cost per-patient for those on oral agents =N27, 159.38 ({\$}194.00); Cost per patient for concomitant medication=N39, 404.69 ({\$}281.46). Hypertension occurred as a concurrent illness in most of the patients (n=31; 83.78{\%}) and were equally treated for hypertension. The total cost of drugs in all the patients= N1, 219,932.70 ({\$}8,713.81); Total cost of illness (COI) for one year for the 37 patients =N 1, 360.369.80({\$}9716.93); Average cost of illness per patient/ year=N36, 766.75({\$}262.22); 84{\%} of annual per capital income. The cost of treating an estimated 3{\%} prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the country is about N150 billion annually excluding the indirect cost. Conclusion: The cost associated with diabetes is enormous. Adequate consideration for cost implication of chosen therapy is indispensable. Economic evaluation of therapy should be encouraged to ensure improved cost effectiveness and efficiency in management. Regularly up-dated drug formulary and evidence-based standard treatment guidelines would ensure better choice of therapeutic options. More importantly, a concerted effort is needed to reduce the incidence of diabetes mellitus in the society. Copyright 2006 - Annals of African Medicine.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The socioeconomics of diabetes from a developing country: A population based cost of illness study}}
      \field{abstract}{Objective: To assess the annual health care expenditure for a patient with diabetes and extrapolate the same to country specific prevalence estimates for 2010. Methods: This population based, cost of illness study collected retrospective data for last 12 months on direct costs (medical and non-medical) through records, indirect cost through human capital approach and intangible cost by contingent valuation method from diabetes patients. Results: Out of 4677 subjects screened, 1050 had diabetes and 718 participated in the survey. The median annual direct and indirect cost associated with diabetes care was estimated at 25,391 INR ({\$}525.5) and 4970 INR ({\$}102.8), respectively. Extrapolating the direct and indirect estimates to Indian population, the annual costs for diabetes would be 1541.4 billion INR ({\$}31.9 billion) in 2010. Two-way sensitivity analysis assuming 10{\%} variation in both prevalence of diabetes and in treatment costs resulted in an estimated cost range of 1230 billion INR ({\$}25.5 billion) to 1837.3 billion INR ({\$}38.0 billion). Conclusion: Keeping the future diabetes explosion in mind, this heavy economic burden highlights the urgent need for the decision makers to allocate resources for planning and implementing strategies in prevention and management of diabetes and its complications. 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The link between family history and risk of type 2 diabetes is not explained by anthropometric, lifestyle or genetic risk factors: the EPIC-InterAct study.}}
      \field{abstract}{AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although a family history of type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for the disease, the factors mediating this excess risk are poorly understood. In the InterAct case-cohort study, we investigated the association between a family history of diabetes among different family members and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, as well as the extent to which genetic, anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors mediated this association. METHODS: A total of 13,869 individuals (including 6,168 incident cases of type 2 diabetes) had family history data available, and 6,887 individuals had complete data on all mediators. Country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox models were fitted within country, and HRs were combined using random effects meta-analysis. Lifestyle and anthropometric measurements were performed at baseline, and a genetic risk score comprising 35 polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes was created. RESULTS: A family history of type 2 diabetes was associated with a higher incidence of the condition (HR 2.72, 95{\%} CI 2.48, 2.99). Adjustment for established risk factors including BMI and waist circumference only modestly attenuated this association (HR 2.44, 95{\%} CI 2.03, 2.95); the genetic score alone explained only 2{\%} of the family history-associated risk of type 2 diabetes. The greatest risk of type 2 diabetes was observed in those with a biparental history of type 2 diabetes (HR 5.14, 95{\%} CI 3.74, 7.07) and those whose parents had been diagnosed with diabetes at a younger age ({\textless}50 years; HR 4.69, 95{\%} CI 3.35, 6.58), an effect largely confined to a maternal family history. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prominent lifestyle, anthropometric and genetic risk factors explained only a marginal proportion of the excess risk associated with family history, highlighting the fact that family history remains a strong, independent and easily assessed risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Discovering factors that will explain the association of family history with type 2 diabetes risk will provide important insight into the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE This study provides nationally representative estimates for the U.S. of medical expenditures associated with diabetes by years since initial diagnosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Expenditures are estimated using cross-sectional regression analysis on the 2000-2004 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to the 1998-2003 National Health Interview Survey (n = 46,203). The primary variables of interest are an indicator for self-reported diabetes and the years since diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS Under the base specification, a 50-year-old person just diagnosed with diabetes has medical expenditures that are 4,174 USD higher than an identical person without diabetes. On average, each additional year with diabetes increases annual medical expenditures by {\$}158 (standard error = {\$}38) above and beyond increases in medical expenditures due to aging. Conditional on diabetes complications, each additional year with diabetes increases annual medical expenditures by {\$}75 (standard error = {\$}55). Diabetes increases medical expenditures at any age, and the cumulative effect grows over time. CONCLUSIONS The results show the expected trajectory of medical expenditures after diagnosis of diabetes, highlighting the benefits of prevention and control as well as informing cost-effectiveness models of diabetes interventions.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{The impact of diabetes on employment and work productivity}}
      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVE - The purpose of this study was to longitudinally examine the effect of diabetes on labor market outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Using secondary data from the first two waves (1992 and 1994) of the Health and Retirement Study, we identified 7,055 employed respondents (51-61 years of age), 490 of whom reported having diabetes in wave 1. We estimated the effect of diabetes in wave 1 on the probability of working in wave 2 using probit regression. For those working in wave 2, we modeled the relationships between diabetic status in wave 1 and the change in hours worked and work-loss days using ordinary least-squares regressions and modeled the presence of health-related work limitations using probit regression. All models control for health status and job characteristics and are estimated separately by sex. RESULTS- Among individuals with diabetes, the absolute probability of working was 4.4 percentage points less for women and 7.1 percentage points less for men relative to that of their counterparts without diabetes. Change in weekly hours worked was not statistically significantly associated with diabetes. Women with diabetes had 2 more work-loss days per year compared with women without diabetes. Compared with individuals without diabetes, men and women with diabetes were 5.4 and 6 percentage points (absolute increase), respectively, more likely to have work limitations. CONCLUSIONS - This article provides evidence that diabetes affects patients, employers, and society not only by reducing employment but also by contributing to work loss and health-related work limitations for those who remain employed. 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVES: This report assessed the cost and burden of diabetes in broad terms of economic status, underlying disability, and barriers to health care--that is, as reflected in employment, income, disability days, general health status, and access to medical care. METHODS: We used the 1990 to 1995 Behavioral Risk Factor Survey in Oklahoma to compare persons with diabetes with age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched respondents without diabetes. RESULTS: Persons with diabetes were significantly and substantially worse off on all economic, disability, and access measures. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nondiabetic persons, diabetic persons have fewer resources to deal with higher levels of disability and poorer health status.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Factors affecting costs and utilization of type 2 diabetes healthcare: a cross-sectional survey among 15 hospitals in urban China}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects persons of all ages, while also placing heavy economic burdens on national economies and healthcare systems. The study aims to investigate the determinants of direct medical cost (DMC), out-of-pocket (OOP) proportion of the cost, and healthcare utilization associated with T2DM. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in four major cities in China. Eligible subjects were adult outpatients who received treatment at one of 15 sampled secondary or tertiary hospitals and consecutively enrolled between March 2007 and May 2007. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine impact factors associated with DMC and healthcare utilization. RESULTS Insurance schemes and receiving insulin therapy were significantly associated with a higher annual DMC of T2DM. For each increase in number of complications, there was about 33{\%} increase in annual DMC. Insurance schemes were significantly associated with the proportions of DMC from pocket. A 7{\%} significantly lower proportion of DMC was paid and 23{\%} more clinic visits (AOR = 1.232, P {\textless} 0.001) were made by patients admitted at secondary hospitals than tertiary hospitals. The group with higher income ({\textgreater} 2000 CNY/month) paid 23{\%} less from their pocket, compared with the lower income group. The number of complications also significantly increased the outpatient visits (AOR = 1.064, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS It implies that preventing complications through the use of more effective treatment regimens is important in order to control the healthcare expenditures of the diseases. Healthcare reform needs to be focused on the medical insurance system and redistribution of patients in hospitals of different levels.}

      \field{abstract}{OBJECTIVES To estimate the direct and indirect costs of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China in 2007 and project these costs for the year 2030, and to examine and compare the benefits of selected interventions. STUDY DESIGN Annual direct costs of medical and nonmedical care and indirect costs of income losses were estimated through case calculation of data from a cross-sectional survey carried out in 4 major Chinese cities from March 2007 to September 2007. METHODS The subjects were consecutively recruited T2DM outpatients and inpatients from 20 secondary and tertiary hospitals using selection probability proportional to size sampling. We combined the existing data from cost-effectiveness studies into the case estimation to examine the benefits of the observed regime of interventions for preventing and treating diabetes. RESULTS Annual direct medical and direct nonmedical costs per case averaged 1320.90 USD and 180.80 USD, respectively. The mean annual indirect costs of T2DM and its complications were estimated to be 206.10 USD. Based on case numbers in 2007 and projected case numbers in 2030, the direct medical costs of T2DM and its complications were estimated to be 26.0 billion USD in 2007 and were projected to be 47.2 billion USD in 2030. CONCLUSIONS The results indicated that T2DM consumes a large portion of healthcare expenditures and will continue to place a heavy burden on health budgets in the future. Preventive intervention, screening, and treatment strategies may effectively decrease the incidence and complications of diabetes and therefore save costs.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Age-specific direct healthcare costs attributable to diabetes in a Swedish population: a register-based analysis.}}
      \field{abstract}{Aims The aim of this population-based study was to explore the age-specific additional direct healthcare cost for patients with diabetes compared with the non-diabetic population. Methods In 1999–2005, patients with diabetes in the Swedish county of {\"{O}}sterg{\"{o}}tland (n = 20 876) were identified from an administrative database. Cost data on the healthcare expenditure in primary healthcare, out-patient hospital care and in-patient care for the entire county population (n = {\~{}}415 000) in 2005 were extracted from a cost per patient (CPP) data- base, which includes information on all utilized healthcare resources in the county. Data on drug sales were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Results The cost per person was 1.8 times higher in patients with diabetes than in the non-diabetic population, 7.7 times higher in children and 1.3 times higher in subjects aged {\textgreater} 75 years. The additional cost per person for diabetes was {\$}1971; {\$}3930 and {\$}1367, respectively, for children and subjects aged {\textgreater} 75 years. The proportion of total additional diabetes costs attributable to in-patient care increased with age from 25 to 50{\%}; in-patient care was the most expensive component at all ages except in children, for whom visiting a specialist was most expensive. The diabetes-related segment of the total healthcare cost was 6.6{\%}, increasing from 2.0{\%} in children to 10.3{\%} in the age group 65–74 years, declining to 6.2{\%} in the oldest age group. Conclusions The direct medical cost of diabetes varies considerably by age. Knowledge about the influence of age on healthcare costs to society will be important in future planning of diabetes management.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Chronic Diseases and Labour Force Participation in Australia}}
      \field{abstract}{We examine the impact of several chronic diseases on the probability of labour force participation using data from the Australian National Health Surveys. An endogenous multivariate probit model is used to account for the potential endogeneity of the incidence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mental illnesses. The cross-equation correlations are significant, rejecting the exogeneity of the chronic illnesses. Marginal effects of exogenous socio-demographic and lifestyle variables are estimated through their direct effects on labour market participation and indirect effects via the chronic diseases. The treatment effects of chronic diseases on labour force participation are estimated via conditional probabilities using five-dimensional normal distributions. The estimated effects differ by gender and age groups. Although computationally more demanding, these treatment effects are compared with results from a univariate model treating the chronic conditions exogenous and the structural effects from the multivariate probit model; both significantly overestimate the effects.}

      \field{labeltitle}{{Transferability of indirect cost of chronic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.}}
      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: Indirect cost is an important component in economic evaluations. The variation in the magnitude of indirect costs across studies and countries is substantial and affects the transferability of results across jurisdictions. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the factors involved in the variation of reported indirect cost and investigated the feasibility of transferring indirect costs across settings. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies estimating indirect costs for four selected chronic diseases, namely, asthma (AS), diabetes (DI), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and schizophrenia (SC). A multiple linear regression analysis was run to identify the factors that potentially explain the variation in reported indirect costs. Parametric (fixed- and random-effect models) and non-parametric (bootstrapping method) meta-analyses were applied to local gross domestic product (GDP)/capita-adjusted indirect costs for each disease. Results from the three different analytical methods were compared to ascertain the robustness of estimation. RESULTS: The systematic literature review identified 77 articles that reported indirect costs of AS (n = 18), DI (n = 20), RA (n = 25) and SC (n = 14) for literature synthesis. Substantial inter- and intra-disease variations among the indirect cost studies were observed with respect to geographic distribution, methodology and magnitude of cost estimation. Regression analysis showed that disease categories and local GDP/capita significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) contributed to the variance of indirect cost. The range of intra-disease variation in indirect costs was substantially reduced after adjusting by and expressing values as local GDP/capita. The GDP-adjusted indirect cost in terms of percentage of local GDP/capita of AS was the lowest and that of SC was the highest. Bootstrapping estimation was relatively conservative, with slightly wider confidence intervals (CIs) than the parametric method, with a mean (95 {\%} CI) of 2.12 {\%} (1.4089-2.9332) for AS, 10.65 {\%} (7.215-14.7438) for DI, 21.98 {\%} (17.4360-27.0631) for RA, and 79.19 {\%} (52.4243-117.833) for SC. CONCLUSION: It would be convenient and feasible to construct a universal reference range of indirect cost for a specific disease based on existing data and present this as a percentage of local GDP to assist local decision making in jurisdictions where indirect cost data are not available.}
