A diabetes diagnosis entails important consequences for its recipients. Diagnosed patients obtain health information but also face the challenge of having to manage the condition via lifestyle adjustments, with potential consequences for---among other things---their economic activity. We investigate the causal effect of a diabetes diagnosis on employment status and behavioural risk-factors, two potentially intertwined factors, using longitudinal data from the \acf{CHNS} that cover the years 1997 to 2011. Two complementary statistical techniques---marginal structural models and fixed effects panel estimation---are used for the statistical analysis, and generate very similar results despite their different underlying assumptions. Both strategies find distinct patterns for males and females. They suggest a decrease in female employment chances after a diagnosis (over 11 percentage points) and further show that women are mostly unable to positively change their behavioural risk factors by loosing weight and reducing energy intake. Men, however, do not see their employment probabilities affected by diabetes and also respond to a diagnosis by losing weight and reducing energy intake as well as their intake of alcohol in ways that are sustained over time. These results suggest important inequities in the impact of diabetes between sexes in China and point to the potential of reducing behavioural risk factors for women to narrow these inequities.

\section{\label{sec:Introduction5}Introduction}

The effect of diabetes on employment status has received relatively little attention in \acp{MIC}, including China. The scarce existing evidence indicates that diabetes can affect labour market outcomes in \acp{HIC}, but also in \acp{MIC} \parencite{Seuring2016}. This is of growing relevance especially with diabetes appearing increasingly earlier in a person's productive lifespan, among others due to increasing obesity at earlier ages. Importantly, once diagnosed, the onset of diabetes, and diabetes complications, strongly depend on the patient's behaviour. Behavioural risk factors like alcohol consumption, smoking, caloric consumption and weight gain are all related to the onset of diabetes as well as ensuing diabetes complications. Research shows for instance that behaviour changes after a diabetes diagnosis can have positive health effects and reduce the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events \parencite{Long2014} and may help in effectively managing blood glucose levels and achieving further treatment goals \parencite{Zhou2016}. Consequently, if these risk factors can be reduced it may be possible to prevent some of the health and economic burden of diabetes. Thus, it seems that a diabetes diagnosis may present an important opportunity to reduce risk factors for diabetes complications \parencite{DeFineOlivarius2015} and hence also reduce the economic burden of diabetes to the individual. This raises the question how diabetes diagnosis affects both labour outcomes and health behaviour over time.

However, one of the challenges of determining a causal relationship between  diabetes, employment status and changes in behavioural risk factors is their potential interrelatedness. For example, employment status might by affecting weight status by reducing the time spend on physical activity due to reductions in available leisure time, or it may promote risk factors such as smoking behaviour or energy intake that can both affect the probability of developing diabetes as well as diabetes related complications, for instance by increasing stress levels. In an effort to  investigate the dynamic impact of unemployment on health behaviours, \textcite{Colman2014} found heterogeneous effects of unemployment, with it leading to slight weight gain, a decrease in smoking and decreases in fast-food consumption. Macroeconomic evidence also indicates that job loss can lead to changes in health, especially in mental health \parencite{Charles2008}, which may have further downstream effects on health behaviours.

Research on the impact of diabetes on labour market outcomes has so far ignored the potentially simultaneous relationship of diabetes with employment and behavioural diabetes risk factors. Using regression techniques such as \ac{OLS} or \ac{FE} it is assumed that the investigated independent variables are unaffected by prior values of the dependent variable. However, if prior changes in employment status are causally related to a diabetes diagnosis or affect the risk factors for diabetes complications, not accounting for this can lead to biased estimates.\footnote{One solution is to include lagged values of the dependent variable on the right hand side, but this raises challenges of its own, including difficulty of interpretation, but also potentially biased estimates. The lagged dependent variable will be correlated with the time-invariant part of the error-term, violating the assumption of exogeneity of the right-hand side variables. Further, if the other covariates are correlated with the lagged-dependent variable, they will also be biased \parencite{Anderson1982,Nickell1981}.} Similarly, studies investigating the impact of a diabetes diagnosis on behavioural risk factors while not taking into account the effect of employment status on both diabetes and these risk factors, may produce biased estimates. Moreover, apart from time-varying confounding due to observed covariates, unobserved variable present a further challenge. In particular time-invariant confounders, such as poor early life conditions or personal trades, may simultaneously increase the probabilities to develop diabetes, be unemployed and engage in unhealthy behaviour. 

The goal of this study is therefore to assess the impact of a diabetes diagnosis on both employment probabilities and behavioural risk factors while accounting for the potentially intertwined relationships between diabetes, employment and health behaviours. This is done via the use of \acp{MSM}, an estimation strategy that is increasingly common in epidemiology and is able to account for time-dependent confounding across time \parencite{Robins2000} when estimating the impact of a treatment, here a diabetes diagnosis, on the outcome of interest. This is, by our knowledge, the first time this estimation strategy is used to estimate the impact of diabetes on an individual's employment status or behavioural risk factors. We complement this strategy and test the robustness of the \ac{MSM} estimates to the potential violation of one of its crucial assumptions, namely that unmeasured confounding factors are not important. To do this, we compare them with \ac{FE} models which, although unable to account for the potentially bidirectional relationship account for unobserved time-invariant confounding factors in addition to confounding due to observed variables. Very different results to the \ac{MSM} would suggest a violation of the assumption of no unobserved confounding. To further investigate and understand the role of confounding factors, we also estimate \ac{RE} models and compare the results. also provides unique analytical insights.  It further extends the evidence base for the impact of diabetes on labour outcomes in \acp{MIC}, where currently empirical information is only available for Mexico \parencite{Seuring2016}. At the same time the study provides, as far as we are aware, the first longitudinal evidence for the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on behavioural risk factors in any developing  country.

 
More information about the effects of a diabetes diagnosis may be particularly important for \acp{LMIC} such as China, where diabetes prevalence has surged from 1\% in the early 1980s to about 10\% in recent years \autocite{Hu2011,Risk2016}. Confronting this diabetes epidemic puts a strain on healthcare systems \parencite{Seuring2015a}, increasing the need to find highly cost-effective prevention and treatment options in very resource constraint settings \parencite{WHOresearchpriorities2010}. However, to do this it is important to assess how successful people with diabetes currently are in preventing adverse economic effects and reducing their risk factors for diabetes complications.


%Finally, another study on China also used diabetes biomarkers to identify those formally unaware of their diabetes, assuming that they were informed about their diabetes status by the survey team \parencite{Liu2014}. They use a difference in difference approach to identify the effect of a diagnosis on labour income in the wave after diagnosis, finding a decrease of about 16\%. They attribute this effect to the psychological consequences of the diabetes diagnosis, however, they are not able to rule out an effect of a deterioration of health on income. Further, the results only provide a short term picture, and it remains unclear if people are able to recover from the initial shock. ONLY INCLUDE IF I ALSO LOOK AT INCOME


The literature trying to identify a causal relationship between diabetes and employment has relied on \ac{IV} strategies \parencite{Brown2005,Latif2009,Seuring2015} and individual \ac{FE} models \parencite{Seuring2016}. However, while an \ac{IV} approach could potentially account for all forms of confounding, the validity of the used instruments is at least questionable (see discussion in Chapter \ref{cha:Mex2}). The \ac{FE} model, as discussed above, also relies on important assumptions that may be violated. Turning to the relationship between a diabetes diagnosis and behavioural risk factors, only one study has intended to causally relate a recent diabetes diagnosis with changes in health behaviours in the USA, finding positive behaviour changes shortly after diagnosis. The study that the effects were mostly short lived and tended to dissipate over time, particularly considering weight loss \parencite{Slade2012}. To isolate the causal effect \textcite{Slade2012} created an "at risk" control group without diabetes that intended to be similar to the treatment group with diabetes, apart from not having received a diagnosis. He used information on diabetes biomarkers to estimate the propensity score of those without a diabetes diagnosis to be above a specific at risk threshold, so that everybody above a certain propensity score was used to form the control group. He then estimated dynamic population average models, including the lagged dependent variable on the right hand side, as well as \ac{FE} models to identify a causal relationship. While this approach likely improves the control group by increasing its similarity in the diabetes risk profile to the diagnosed population, the use of a lagged dependent variable may have biased the estimates due to unobserved time-invariant variables being correlated with the lagged dependent variable, violating the exogeneity assumption and potentially introducing bias in the other covariates. This is also true for the \ac{FE} model \parencite{Nickell1981,Anderson1982}. Further, the study did not account for employment status as one of the control variables. 

A different identification approach was used by \textcite{Zhao2013a} when investigating the effects of a hypertension diagnosis on nutritional outcomes in China. They used a regression-discontinuity design and biomarker information on blood pressure. A crucial assumption in the study was that people above the hypertension threshold were indeed informed about their hypertension while those just below the threshold were not. These two groups were then compared to isolate the particular effect of the additional health information on food consumption in the following wave. The results indicated that a diagnosis leads to reductions in fat consumption, but no other nutritional outcomes, and only for those economically better off. Several caveats exist for this study and the used approach. According to \textcite{Zhao2013a} it was not always clear to what extent participants where informed about their hypertension status and whether they had received just the actual blood pressure measurement information, leaving the interpretation to the participants, or whether they were made explicitly aware of their hypertension (or also pre-hypertension) status. Further, the results may have limited generalisability, since the measured treatment effect was a very local one, applying only to the population around the hypertension threshold. Finally, the study only provides information for a relatively short period until the first wave after diagnosis, unable to capture any changes further away from the point of diagnosis. 

Accordingly, there is a need to provide new evidence on the effects of a diabetes diagnosis on employment status as well as behavioural risk behaviours that could affect the development of diabetes complications, using longitudinal data and alternative estimation strategies. Thereby this study adds in several ways to the existing literature. First, it shows the impact of diabetes diagnosis on labour outcomes in China, not only over the short term, but for a period covering the entire decade of the 2000s, allowing for a more long term investigation of the effects. This both confirms and extends earlier evidence for other settings and using different methods. Second, it provides information on the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on health behaviours. Third, by considering the effects over time on both employment and health behaviour, the results shed light on potential pathways through which the impact on employment may work.  Fourth, the study provides a methodological innovation by using both \ac{MSM} and \ac{FE} estimation methods, offering insights not only on the robustness of the \ac{MSM} results, but also on the validity of some of its assumptions.  


\section{\label{sec:Methods5}Methods}

\subsection{Study sample}


The \ac{CHNS} is an international collaborative project led by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill investigating nutrition and health behaviours in nine provinces of China \parencite{Zhang2014d}. We use data from 1997 onwards, which was the first time survey participants provided diabetes information. In total we use six waves (1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011) obtained from the longitudinal dataset released in 2015. The data provide extensive information on nutrition and health, including anthropometric measures of weight and height, reducing potential measurement issues. It further provides socioeconomic information, most importantly for this study about employment. The sample is limited to the adult population from age 18--64.  The sample is not nationally representative and as such does not provide sampling weights  \parencite{Popkin2010}.

Overall, between 84\% to 90\% of the survey participants are followed up in the consecutive wave, with attrition being highest after 2006. Attrition in the \ac{CHNS} due to mortality is around 1\% \parencite{Popkin2010}. Other reasons mentioned by \textcite{Popkin2010} are loss in follow up due to migration, natural disasters and redevelopment of housing in the urban centres leading to relocations. We analysed if any of our variables of interest was significantly related to attrition at any wave and did only find lower calorie consumption and being unemployed to exhibit an association. Having diabetes was not related to attrition. Further, attrition was strongly related to urbanization, a higher level of education, being of younger age and having lower family income, suggesting that mostly participants of younger age, more urbanized but from less well-off households tended to leave the survey. Attrition rates between the waves are shown in Table \ref{tab:attrition}.


\subsection{Assessment of diabetes}

We used self-reported information on a diabetes diagnosis to construct our diabetes indicator. We only relied on incident cases of self-reported diabetes, excluding individuals with self-reported diabetes at baseline. Given the chronic nature of diabetes, we assumed that after the initial diagnosis diabetes persists for the rest of one's life. This is a reasonable assumption given the medical evidence \parencite{Steven2016}.\footnote{Recently, a study showed successful remission of at least 6 months in some patients after the initiation of a very low-calorie diet \parencite{Steven2016}. However, while this shows that type 2 diabetes may be reversible, this cannot be expected for patients diagnosed and currently treated in any healthcare system.} To construct a measure of diabetes duration for incidence cases we used self-reported information on the year of diagnosis. If we found that the year of diagnosis was reported to be before the last wave without a reported diagnosis, we used the midpoint between the last wave without diagnosis and the first wave with a diagnosis as the year of diagnosis.\footnote{The number of observations replaced at each wave was: 21 (2000), 44 (2004), 51  (2006), 78 (2009), 59 (2011). Overall it affected 43\% of the self-reports of the year of diagnosis.}

\subsection{Assessment of outcomes}

The economic outcome of interest is employment status, and is measured through self-reported response stating that the person is currently working. People who reported not to be working because they were student are excluded, while those who are not working for any other reason, such as doing housework, being disabled or being retired, were included. 

The behavioural outcomes we estimate are current smoking status, if alcohol was consumed equal to or more than three times per week\footnote{We also estimated models investigating alcohol cessation instead of alcohol reduction, suggesting very similar effects.}, \ac{BMI}, waist circumference in centimetres and daily calorie consumption. Smoking status and alcohol consumption are self-reported, while \ac{BMI} and waist circumference are based on anthropometric measurements, minimizing potential reporting errors. Waist circumference is reported in centimetres. Finally, daily calorie consumption is a constructed variable available in the \ac{CHNS}, based on the average daily consumption of carbohydrates, protein and fat of every individual in the survey, measured on three consecutive days. As robustness tests, we also considered overweight and obesity indicators instead of a continuous weight variable. These results suggest similar patterns. Since there is considerable discussion about the correct thresholds to use for Asian populations to define overweight and obesity \parencite{WHO2004,He2015,Zeng2014a}, we do not include these results in our main analysis but report them in appendix. We applied thresholds suggested by the China Obesity Task Force of a \ac{BMI} $\geq$ 24 to define overweight and a \ac{BMI} $\geq$ 28 to define obesity \parencite{group2004body}.


\subsection{Statistical analysis}


Our analysis focuses on two statistical approaches to account for potential confounding: \acfp{MSM} and \acf{FE}. 

\subsubsection*{Marginal structural models}

\acp{MSM} apply inverse probability weights to adjust for confounding and selection bias as a result of time-varying confounders being affected by prior exposure to the treatment \autocite{Robins2000}. Under the assumption of the \ac{MSM}\autocite{Robins2000}---the reported treatment is the treatment that has actually been received (consistency), there are no unmeasured confounders (exchangeability) and every person in the sample has a non-zero chance of receiving the treatment (positivity) (see Section \ref{sec:Discussion5} for a discussion of the validity of these assumptions in our case)---the causal \ac{DAG} shown in Figure \ref{fig:DAG_msm} displays the association between confounders and outcomes and a diabetes diagnosis.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\caption{\label{fig:DAG_msm} Direct acyclic graph for the marginal structural model}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Chapter5/DAG/dag_msm_alt}
\end{center}
\footnotesize{\textit{Notes} \acp{MSM} assume the absence of unobserved time-invariant and unobserved time-variant confounders but allow the past treatments to affect the current outcomes  (arrows going from Diabetes to time-variant covariates) and the past outcomes to affect the current treatment (arrows going from time-variant covariates to Diabetes).  Lagged time-variant covariates, baseline and time-invariant covariates predict current diabetes status.}

\end{figure}
\clearpage

In our context it seems possible that, for example, \ac{BMI} could affect the probability of being diagnosed with diabetes which then itself may affect subsequent \ac{BMI} levels, confounding the relationship between a diabetes diagnosis and \ac{BMI} due to non-random selection. Similarly, employment history and current employment could affect the probability of a diabetes diagnosis through their impact on lifestyle and hence diabetes risk factors such as increases in weight or smoking. For example, an increase in disposable income or a reduction in leisure time as a result of a new job and the subsequent effect on risk behaviours could confound the relationship between a diabetes diagnosis and employment status. \ac{MSM} accounts for this by calculating weights based on the potential risk of a person being diagnosed at each point in time. 

To calculate these weights we first construct unstabilized weights using baseline values of time-variant confounders, time-invariant confounders as well as time-variant confounders lagged by one period to predict the probability of developing diabetes at each wave. We use lagged time-variant confounders because current diabetes status as reported in the survey was determined at some point within the current and the previous wave that were determined before the current diabetes status, to prevent reverse causality. The used predictors are age and age squared to account for changes in risk with increasing age, an index of urbanization pre-constructed within the \ac{CHNS} data, ranging from 1 to 120 as the level of urbanization increases \parencite{Zhang2014d}, to account for the impact of urbanization on diabetes risk \parencite{Attard2012}. We also use secondary and university education, being married, having any medical insurance, being of Han ethnicity, living in a rural area, dummies for the different Chinese regions and the respective survey waves as predictors. Further we use inflation adjusted per-capita household income to adjust for effects of household wealth on diabetes. Finally, all outcome variables (employment status, alcohol consumption, smoking status, \ac{BMI}, waist circumference and average daily calorie consumption) are used as predictors. 

Because unstabilized weights can be highly variable it is recommended to stabilize the weights \parencite{Cole2008}. Using the unstabilized weights as the denominator, stabilized weights are calculated by dividing the denominator by the predicted treatment propensity from a model using only time-invariant confounders and baseline information of the time-variant confounders as predictors.  Because our analysis is stratified by males and females, we create weights separately for both groups.

The \acp{MSM} are estimated using \ac{OLS} for the continuous and a logistic model for the binary outcomes. For the logistic model we calculate average marginal effects for greater comparability with the results of the \ac{FE} models. All models are weighted by the stabilized weights constructed beforehand while adjusting for all baseline and time-invariant covariates used in the calculation of the stabilized weights, except for the respective outcome of interest. Robust standard errors to account for intra-class correlation of repeated outcome measurements in individuals are used throughout. In our primary analysis, we present the results of the \ac{MSM} with untruncated stabilized weights, as these provide theoretically unbiased estimates, albeit they likely are less efficient than truncated weights \parencite{Cole2008}. The distribution of the inverse probability weights supports this decision as there are no extreme values and the mean weight is 1 (see Table \ref{tab:stabweights}).

\subsubsection*{Fixed effects}

While the \ac{MSM} can account for pre-treatment selection on observable and time-variant confounders, it assumes that there are no unobserved time-invariant confounders such as family background, cognitive abilities, and other personal characteristics. This is a strong assumption that might be violated in practice. The individual level \ac{FE} model can help remedy this problem as it is able to account for both observed time-variant and invariant variables as well as time-invariant unobserved variables as shown in the \ac{DAG} in Figure \ref{fig:DAG_fe}. It does so by demeaning all covariates at each time point with the overall individual mean across all observed time points. It then uses solely the within-person variation for identification, thereby accounting for any time-invariant observed or unobserved as well as observed time-variant effects. 


This comes at a price: due to the demeaning, time-invariant variables such as Han ethnicity, are dropped from the model and cannot be estimated. Further, because the \ac{FE} model is not able to account for any effects of a diabetes diagnosis on other time-variant confounders, only a more limited set of confounders can be included compared to the \ac{MSM}. Otherwise the estimates of the effect of a diabetes diagnosis would likely be biased due to the inclusion of 'bad controls'. Bad controls are control variables that have been affected by the treatment itself---such as \ac{BMI} or smoking status after a diabetes diagnosis---and therefore likely capture part of the causal effect of diabetes on the outcome of interest, biasing the diabetes coefficient \parencite{Angrist2009a}. Our \ac{FE} specifications thus only include controls for age, age squared, the level of urbanization, education, being married, having any medical insurance, living in a rural area, region and time dummies as well as per capita household income. For the estimation of the effect of time since diagnosis, the linear age variable is dropped. In \ac{FE} models, two or more variables that change at the same rate between waves cannot be separately identified. In our case this applies for age and time-dummies, as both variables increase by one each additional year \parencite{Wooldridge2012}. To identify the effect of diabetes duration we have to rely on the presence of people without diabetes in the sample, for which diabetes duration does not increase at the same rate as time. \ac{FE} models also make another assumption, which have received much less attention, namely that there is no dynamic causal relationship between treatment and outcomes, i.e. that past treatments have no direct effect on current outcomes, and that past outcomes no direct effect on current treatment. If this assumption is violated, then results based on \ac{FE}, or any non-dynamic estimation method are biased \parencite{Imai2016}. Accordingly, the choice between the use of a \ac{FE} model or a \ac{MSM} depends on the tradeoff between unobserved time-invariant confounding and dynamic causal relationships between diabetes and our outcome variables.\footnote{Because it is not possible to retrieve average marginal effects from a logistic \ac{FE} model, we prefer to use a linear \ac{FE} model instead. It generally produces very similar estimates compared to non-linear models \parencite{Angrist2009a}.}

\end{center}
\footnotesize{\textit{Notes} \ac{FE} models account for time-invariant unobserved confounding (light grey circle), but still assume the absence of unobserved time-variant confounding. They further do not allow for past outcomes to affect the current treatment, i.e. diabetes status. }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Random effects}

Random effects assume, similar to the \ac{MSM}, no unmeasured confounding, and similar to the \ac{FE} model no dynamic relationship between diabetes and our outcomes. Under these assumptions the \ac{RE} model is efficient and consistent, making it the preferable estimator if its assumptions are not violated. It is also preferable over the pooled \ac{OLS} estimator, as the \ac{RE} estimator takes into account the serial correlation of the errors across time \parencite{Wooldridge2012}. 

To discriminate between the \ac{RE} and \ac{FE} estimator, a robust Hausman test is carried out using the user written Stata command xtoverid. A rejection of the null hypothesis suggests that the underlying \ac{RE} assumptions are false and the \ac{FE} model should be used instead \parencite{Wooldridge2012}.\footnote{We use the original non-imputed data to carry out the Hausman test.} 



\subsubsection*{Multiple imputation}

To deal with missing data, we used chained multiple imputation to impute the missing values in Stata 13 using the user written ICE command \parencite{Royston2009}. Overall, thirty imputed datasets were created. Imputation models included all variables used in the \acp{MSM}. We imputed missing data in the same wave for which some data were recorded; we did not impute completely missing waves. Further, we did not impute missing diabetes information and instead assumed that once a diabetes diagnosis was reported, the individual had diabetes in every ensuing wave, even when the observation was missing. If diabetes was never reported in any wave, we assumed that the individual never had diabetes. We then only imputed missing values for those observations that had a non-missing diabetes status. For the calculation of the marginal effects in the \ac{MSM} logit models, Rubin's rules were applied using the user written Stata command mimrgns \parencite{Klein2014}.

\subsubsection*{Numbers of observations}

Because we used lagged variables to construct the stabilized weights for the \acp{MSM}, the number of observations used in the \acp{MSM} is lower than those used in the \ac{FE} and \ac{RE} models, where we do not use lagged variables. The summary statistics shown in Table \ref{tab:descriptives_diab} are based on the observations used in the \ac{FE} models. The number of observations is stated below each table.

\subsubsection*{Sensitivity analyses}

We conduct three additional sensitivity analyses in order to test the robustness of our results. First, we truncate weights at the 1\textsuperscript{st} and 99\textsuperscript{th} percentile to investigate the sensitivity of the \acp{MSM} to the most extreme weights. While untruncated weights provide unbiased estimates under the assumptions of the \ac{MSM}, they may not be the most efficient and tend to have larger standard errors \parencite{Cole2008}. Second, we estimate the \ac{FE} and \acp{MSM} using the original non-imputed data to ascertain the extent to which multiple imputation affected the results. Third, we report in the appendix the estimates of models using overweight and obesity instead of \ac{BMI} and waist circumference as the outcomes of interest, to investigate the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on changes in the probabilities to be overweight or obese.

\section{\label{sec:Results5}Results}

From the descriptive statistics, we can observe that people with diabetes in any wave are less likely to be employed. Looking at health behaviours, the prevalence of smoking and drinking is lower for men with diabetes; they also consume fewer calories compared to men without diabetes.  Note that it is mainly men who smoke and report alcohol consumption while very few women do so. Further, the diabetes group has both higher \ac{BMI} and waist circumference levels. They are also older, live in more urbanized areas, are more likely to have insurance and men are somewhat better educated while women are less educated compared to their counterparts without diabetes. Both men and women report an average time since diagnosis of around 4.5 years. Looking at per capita household income, men and women with diabetes come from household with higher income levels than those without a diabetes diagnosis. Further it appears that in China it is less educated women that report a diagnosis, while men with diabetes are better educated compared to those without diabetes.

Predicting the denominator for the stabilized weights we find that for men a higher baseline \ac{BMI} increases the risk of a diabetes diagnosis. Further, increases in age, waist circumference as well as urbanization levels are associated with higher chances for men to be diagnosed with diabetes throughout the survey. Interestingly becoming employed decreases the chances of being diagnosed with diabetes slightly, justifying the use of the \ac{MSM} in our employment models as well  (Table \ref{tab:predictors}). Because these are not causal estimates, it may be that it is more likely for men with a lower risk of diabetes to select into employment. Interestingly, we do not find that higher household income levels are predictive of a diagnosis for men or women, despite what the descriptive statistics indicated. For women, higher age and waist circumference at baseline, increases in \ac{BMI} as well as living in a non-rural environment predict a diabetes diagnosis.

The results of our regression analysis are presented in Table \ref{tab:binary}. Both the\ac{MSM} and \ac{FE} model indicate that women with a diabetes diagnosis have lower probabilities of being employed than their counterparts without diabetes, with a reduction of 12 percentage points in the \ac{MSM} and 11 percentage points in the \ac{FE} model. This translates into a relative reduction in employment probabilities between 16--17\%. For men no such effect is observed.



A more ambiguous picture is painted for the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on behavioural risk factor outcomes. According to the \ac{MSM}, for males a diabetes diagnosis leads to smoking cessation, reductions in alcohol consumption as well as \ac{BMI}, waist circumference and calorie consumption. Results for women look different. While the point estimates indicate a reduction in all outcomes, these tend to be smaller than those for men and only exhibit strong statistical significance smoking cessation and alcohol consumptions, who already have a very low prevalence. Compared to the \ac{MSM}, the \ac{FE} model finds similar effects for men, apart from a less important effect on smoking cessation.	For women, however, it finds much larger, and statistically significant, reductions in \ac{BMI} and waist circumference. 

The results of the \ac{RE} models suggest an even stronger effect of diabetes on female employment probabilities and  smaller reductions in male and female \ac{BMI} and waist circumference, even suggesting a positive association between a diabetes diagnosis and female waist circumference. For the other outcomes, results are very similar to those from the \acp{MSM} and \ac{FE} models. Nonetheless, the Hausman test still rejects the use of the \ac{RE} model throughout.

Exploring the effect of a diabetes diagnosis over time, we first estimate a specification using time since diagnosis as a continuous variable. The results of the \acp{MSM} (Table \ref{tab:duration}) indicate a steady reduction of female employment probabilities of close to two percentage points per year and of male alcohol consumption, \ac{BMI}, waist circumference and calorie consumption. The \ac{FE} model again supports the finding of the \ac{MSM}, showing very similar, though somewhat larger, effects in terms of size and statistical significance. The evidence for changes in risk factors for females is less consistent across models and outcomes, with the \ac{MSM} suggesting almost no effects while the \ac{FE} model indicates a reduction in \ac{BMI}. The effect sizes for changes in health behaviours in women are consistently lower than those found for men. 

The \ac{RE} models again find larger effects on female employment probabilities and a smaller impact of a diabetes diagnosis on reductions in \ac{BMI} and waist circumference for both sexes.

In a second step we estimate a specification using year dummies to capture the potential non-linearity in the relationship between time since diagnosis and our outcomes. The results for the different estimation methods are visualized in Figures \ref{fig:duration_g_msm_mi}, \ref{fig:duration_g_fe_mi} and \ref{fig:duration_g_re_mi} and presented in Tables \ref{tab:duration_groups_msm}, \ref{tab:duration_groups_fe} and \ref{tab:duration_groups_re} for the \ac{MSM}, \ac{FE} and \ac{RE} model, respectively. Despite the reduced sample size in each group and hence lower precision, the \ac{MSM} model still indicates a reduction in female employment chances and male \ac{BMI}, waist circumference and calorie consumption as well as smoking and alcohol consumption, especially in the first 8 to 10 years after diagnosis. Behavioural risk factors for women are again not found to be reduced consistently, apart from \ac{BMI} where some trend towards a reduction over time is visible. Interestingly, female employment already decreases rapidly in the first to second year after diagnosis and it does not appear that females are able to increase their employment probabilities later on. Unfortunately it was not possible to estimate the effects on female smoking and alcohol consumption due to the low prevalence of these risk factors in females, the lower sample size in the \ac{MSM} and the reductions in sample size in each duration group. Using the \ac{FE} model, all point estimates suggest similar effects. The \ac{RE} model, again suggests larger effects on female employment and lower effects on \ac{BMI} and waist circumference than both other estimation methods. 

The sensitivity analyses using truncated weights shows very similar effects to those using the untruncated weights (Table \ref{tab:truncation} and \ref{tab:duration_groups_tr}), suggesting no important loss in efficiency and supporting the decision to use untruncated weights. The results using non-imputed data are broadly similar (Tables \ref{tab:binary_non_mi}, \ref{tab:duration_non_mi}, \ref{tab:duration_groups_non_mi_msm}, \ref{tab:duration_groups_non_mi_fe} and \ref{tab:duration_groups_non_mi_re} ), in particular for the \ac{FE} model, still indicating a reduction in female employment chances and male alcohol consumption, \ac{BMI} and waist circumference. The coefficients of the \ac{MSM} still point into the same direction as those using the imputed data, but the estimated effects are smaller in size and confidence intervals are relatively large. The \ac{RE} model still shows a stronger effect on female employment probabilities and smaller reductions in especially the weight measures \ac{BMI} and waist circumference. Using overweight and obesity instead of \ac{BMI} and waist circumference as indicators for weight changes, we do not find as consistent reductions in weight status for men as we did using the continuous estimates (Tables \ref{tab:obesity_binary} and \ref{tab:obesity_dur} and Figure \ref{fig:obesity_duration_g}. Nonetheless, the point estimates still show a reduction in obesity, in particular over time and for men, supporting the reductions found using continuous measurements. The coefficients for overweight are difficult to interpret as it is unclear if the negative coefficient is caused by people transferring into the obesity or into normal weight.

\section{\label{sec:Discussion5}Disussion}

The evidence for the impact of a diabetes diagnosis on employment chances and behavioural risk factors remains scarce, in particular in \acp{MIC}, where diabetes has become a mayor contributor to the burden of disease. We added to this evidence by exploring these relationships using longitudinal data from China, also improving upon previous methodology by taking into account the potential relationship over time between these outcomes.

Our results suggest that receiving a diabetes diagnosis in China leads to a strong and lasting reduction in female, but not male employment probabilities. We also found reductions in male \ac{BMI} and waist circumference, alcohol and calorie consumption and potentially smoking. We did, however, not find similar changes in behavioural risk factors for women. Accordingly, it appears that women in China have to endure stronger adverse labour market effects and at the same time are less successful then men at making risk behaviour changes to reduce their risk of diabetes complications.

The \ac{MSM} models and \ac{FE} models indicated very similar results suggesting that they are robust and that time-invariant confounding factors may play a limited role over and above baseline and time varying confounding factors. The \ac{MSM} results suggest that in particular \ac{BMI} and waist circumference levels as well as employment status can cause selection into a diabetes diagnosis and are then later themselves affected by the diagnosis, justifying the use of a \ac{MSM}. The \ac{RE} models further indicated that insufficiently accounting for confounding can---at least in this setting---lead to an overestimation of the impact of diabetes on employment status and an underestimation of the effects of a diagnosis on weight measures (\ac{BMI} and waist circumference). However, confounding may only be of limited relevance for  alcohol consumption, where the \ac{RE} models showed very similar results.

\subsection{Limitations}

The study has several limitations. While we used two estimation methods to reduce the influence of selection bias due to unobserved confounding, they are still unable to account for all forms of selection simultaneously. Therefore a causal interpretation is only possible under restrictive assumptions, namely no unobserved time-variant confounding for the \ac{FE} model and positivity, exchangeability and consistency for the \ac{MSM}. The assumption of positivity is likely to hold, given that every person should have at least a small chance of receiving a diabetes diagnosis. This is also supported by the relatively small range of stabilized weights and absence of zero-weights. Exchangeability, or no unmeasured confounding could potentially be violated if not all time-invariant or time-variant confounders were accounted for, but there is no comprehensive test. We tested for part of this assumption by estimating a \ac{FE} model and given that the results remained very similar, this suggests that unobserved time-invariant confounding may be of limited relevance in this case. Consistency would have been violated if a diabetes diagnosis had been reported but the person had actually not been diagnosed with diabetes. This was likely only violated in very rare cases of misreporting, given that specificity of diabetes self-report is very high in China \autocite{Yuan2015}. Because we were interested in the effect of a diabetes diagnosis, unobserved diabetes did not violate the consistency assumption.

A limitation of the \ac{FE} model is the possibility of time-variant confounding due to prior outcomes (for example employment status) affecting the current treatment (a diabetes diagnosis). Given that the \ac{FE} estimates were close to those of the \acp{MSM}, it is likely that there was no strong confounding due to pre-treatment changes. Rather, the similarity of results suggests that it is important to account for the selection into diabetes due to some form of baseline values, be it via demeaning as in the \ac{FE} model---and thereby accounting for all time-invariant confounding---or by using baseline values as in the \ac{MSM}.

Finally, an important limitation is the that a diabetes diagnosis entails a variety of 'treatments' that are difficult to disentangle and may each have a distinct effect on the explored outcomes. Currently, we are only able to observe the combined effect of these treatments. Firstly, there is the provision of information at diagnosis, potentially causing increases in stress and anxiety, but may also providing an explanation for the experienced symptoms, both potentially affecting productivity. Secondly, a diagnosis also is the starting point for medical treatment, potentially alleviating symptoms and helping with weight loss, but also posing new challenges, in particular if treatment entails the exogenous provision of insulin or strict meal plans, potentially adding to the burden of diabetes in daily life. Thirdly, adherence to medical treatment may be heterogeneous across people with diabetes, with non-adherence likely leading to a further worsening of risk factors for complications, while good adherence may prevent or delay debilitating complications. Fourthly, a diagnosis may also introduce lifestyle changes such as increasing exercise levels, eating healthier and reducing smoking or alcohol consumption, all potentially affecting the risk to develop further complications and to experience changes in productivity. In the current study, it is not possible to ascertain the role of each of these factors in affecting employment chances and behavioural risk factors. Only for the reductions in smoking and alcohol consumption, it seems reasonable to attribute them to diagnosis induced awareness to reduce these risk factors.


\subsection{Potential mechanisms}

There are various pathways that may explain the observed patterns in the effects of a diabetes diagnosis on employment and behavioural risk factors for males and females. 

The found adverse effect of diabetes on employment is in line with other studies on the labour market impact of diabetes that have found diabetes to reduce female employment probabilities \parencite{Minor2010,Latif2009,Harris2009,Seuring2016}---often more than for men. Most comparable to our results is likely a study from Mexico which also used \ac{FE} and data for a similar time period and for a \ac{MIC} that also experienced a rapid epidemiological transformation towards a very high diabetes burden  \parencite{Seuring2016}. The study found significant reductions for both males and females of about 5 percentage points. Taking into account the lower overall employment rate of Mexican women compared to men, this translated into a 16\% reduction in female employment probabilities, a figure comparable to what Chinese women experienced. However, in Mexico also men experienced adverse effects, unlike to what we found for China.

The found effects on changes in behavioural risk factors can be compared to the study by \parencite{Slade2012}. Slade finds reductions in alcohol consumption and smoking, though it appears that these reductions were not maintained over a longer time period. Unfortunately, Slade only provided information for the entire sample and the male sample, so that we cannot compare them directly with our results for women. In terms of the effect on weight, again both studies cannot be directly compared because Slade investigated the effect of a diagnosis on being overweight or obese, while we used continuous weight measures in our primary analysis due to the discussed difficulties of defining cut-off values for Asian populations. Slade found an initial reduction in weight status, but also that people with diabetes tended to become more likely to be overweight or obese after some time. Our results using overweight and obesity could tentatively be interpreted to indicate a more constant reduction in obesity over time, suggesting that reductions in weight in Chinese men may be longer lived than in the USA. Importantly---and in concordance with our findings---he found that simple covariate adjustment led to biased estimates of the impact on weight status, indicating a positive relationship. This underlines the importance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity.

The permanent reduction in male \ac{BMI} and waist circumference we have found has also been observed in a cohort of Danish patients \autocite{DeFineOlivarius2015}, where weight increased the years preceding diagnosis, while after diagnosis weight decreased. The exact reasons for this decrease were unknown but attributed to motivation changes as a result of the diagnosis, concluding that time around the diagnosis may represent a window of opportunity to obtain long lasting weight change. Nonetheless, reductions in weight, as already eluded to in the limitations, may also be the result of treatment initiation with metformin or other diabetes drugs that have been shown to lead to weight reductions \autocite{Yang2014}. Importantly, the reduction in male \ac{BMI} levels and waist circumference were accompanied by reduced energy intake, suggesting that the changes in weight were at least partly the result of lower energy intake.  Further, given that in China diabetes incidence has been especially attributed to a high accumulation of visceral fat and central obesity \autocite{Ma2014}, the reductions in waist circumference may have had a particular positive effect on diabetes control and the prevention of comorbidities. Together, the lower levels of energy intake and waist circumference after the diagnosis allow for the interpretation that the reductions in \ac{BMI} were due to fat loss and not less lean body mass \autocite{Klein2007}. 

For women, however, we did not find similar strong evidence for reductions in \ac{BMI}, waist circumference or energy intake. The relatively smaller effects for women could indicate a lower ability to change behaviours supportive of weight loss. This appears to be supported by the smaller reductions in energy intake. This could have---at least partly---contributed to a higher risk for diabetes complications further down the line, also adversely affecting employment probabilities. Apart from this, other explanations for the lower weight loss and larger employment penalty for women compared to men include their lower educational attainment, which has been indicated as a factor in preventing better glucose control \autocite{Luo2015} and may also affected the ability to successfully change behaviours. Lower income levels for females compared to men may also have negatively affected the ability to receive adequate treatment following a diagnosis, limiting their ability to change health behaviours \autocite{Luo2015}, increasing the risk of complications. We found that women with diabetes lived in households with lower income levels compared to men with diabetes, however, these income levels were still higher then for those without diabetes. Nonetheless, it may still be the case that women were more likely to not access care due to lower income levels than men. Further, there are likely biological factors that lead to worse health outcomes for women compared to men. There is some evidence that, due to different ways of fat storage between men and women, men tend to cross the diabetes threshold at an earlier point in time and at a comparatively healthier metabolic state then women \parencite{Peters2015,Peters2014a,Peters2014}. Women are more likely to have spend more time in a pre-diabetes state \parencite{Bertram2010} and to cross the threshold only once the metabolic has significantly deteriorated, leading to a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke \parencite{Peters2015}. Supporting this, a study for China found a greater prevalence of diabetes comorbidities in Chinese women than men \autocite{Liu2010}. In this light it may not be surprising that we find more conclusive evidence of worsening employment probabilities for women than for men. If women are less likely to receive proper treatment and to change their health behaviours and at the same time have a greater risk for complications then men, the long term effects of diabetes on their health are likely more severe than for men and consequently affect their employment status to a greater extent.

Taken together these estimation results suggest that the effect on the probability of employment is reduced over time due to adaptions in health behaviour, while the effect for women is substantial because no such changes in behaviour take place. Further analysis is needed to test this formally, and is beyond the scope of this paper.





\section{Conclusion}

Our results indicate worse outcomes for women then men after a diabetes diagnosis, with women experiencing a reduction in employment probabilities accompanied by and potentially partly due to an inability to reduce important risk factors for diabetes complications. For males, the opposite pattern is found, as they do not experience adverse employment effects and are able to achieve reductions in the investigated risk factors. These findings are robust to the application of two distinct, but complementary econometric techniques. Further research should try to unravel the mechanisms behind these differential outcomes for men and women. Overall, given the large prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, our results indicate that an early diagnosis may be a good way to foster early behaviour change that could lead to more positive health and economic outcomes for people with diabetes over time. It appears, however, that greater emphasis needs to be put on reducing the burden of diabetes for women if the observed inequities in the diabetes impact shall be reduced.
