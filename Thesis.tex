\chapter*{\label{acknowledgements}Acknowledgements}

Being able to write these lines now at the end of my PhD is the culmination of a lot of luck I have had in my life. I have been so lucky to be able to live a life of my own choosing allowing me to pursue my goals, embark on new adventures and to be surrounded by great people, without whom this thesis would not have been possible. 

First of all, I have to thank my great supervisory team. I never would have thought that I would have the opportunity to work with such kind and bright people. Thank you Marc! Without you I may never have pursued a PhD nor would I have ended up at UEA. It was in Dubai were we first met when I listened to your talk at the International Diabetes Congress, organized by my then employer. I asked a couple of questions after your talk, admittedly rather uncharacteristically for me, but your talk was just right down the alley of what I had done in my Master's thesis. W continued to chat for a few minutes afterwards and exchanged emails. A few months later I contacted you regarding a PhD posting at Cambridge you had been involved in, and after some forth and back it became clear that there could be the opportunity to do a PhD at UEA. Half a year later  me and my wife then actually moved to the charming city of Norwich so that I could start the PhD. From then on it has been a great experience, a lot of work but also a lot of fun. Thank you for always being responsive and helpful, interested in my work, providing great feedback and not hesitating one second to also support me from afar. The same has to be said of Pieter and Max, who became part of the supervisory team more or less at the middle of the road. Thank you Pieter for always pushing me to make my work better, for providing me with new ideas and for always being there when I had a question. I also enjoyed finding some common ground on the experience of being married to a women from Latin America. Thank you Max for being a just as great primary supervisor as Marc had been before going to York, for for introducing me into the world of epidemiology and for taking time out of your busy schedule to sit down with me for several hours on my visits to Norwich to go through Stata code. Of course I also have to thank Olia and Yevgeniy for being such great co-authors on my first two papers.

Then there is Katey, to which I am deeply indebted. I am so grateful that you provided me a home in Norwich and I thoroughly enjoyed going to the pub, or watching the possibly worst movie ever, with you and Gareth. I, of course, cannot forget the big D, one of the major reasons I am doing what I do. You came into my life unannounced and uninvited and I had to learn to live with you because you left me no choice. Despite all the hard times you have given me, I have to thank you for providing me with a personal motivation to pursue the path I am on. I am thankful to be born and life in a part of the world where living with you is difficult but doable, allowing me to live a 'normal' life. I hope that this thesis may be small step towards one day providing every person with diabetes the same possibilities I have had.

Of course, being surrounded only by PhD students (in Norwich) or nobody who has a clue of what I am doing (in Großenlüder), is not always easy. Therefore I am happy to be able to count on a stronghold of friends that provides just the right mix of both worlds. I am especially grateful to Heiner for organizing a two-men conference in Kijkduin and inviting me to many similar events; to Christian for keeping me up to date on the last political chatter in the German Development Ministry; to Alex for always keeping his door open for me in Moabit; to Frank for just being the lifelong friend everybody needs.

Of course this thesis would not have been possible without the best family in the world. Thank you Martin and Angelica for being the best suegros and Annia for being the best cu\~{n}ada I could have asked for. There is also my extended Mexican family, especially Wendy and Javier, which I am so happy to have. Being able to step into another world when visiting you is a blessing. It has given me much needed breaks from the life of a PhD student and being driven across the city to eat the best \textit{gorditas} with \textit{salsa verde con pipicha} is a very special treat. The two times we have visited you over the last four years have always provided during my PhD  Also my two sisters, Anne and Elena, need to be mentioned. I am happy not only having such great sisters but also being able to call you my friends.

\chapter{\label{cha:Mex1}The impact of diabetes on employment in Mexico}
\section*{Pre-amble}

The systematic review in Chapter \ref{cha:review} identified a paucity of studies on the labour market impact of diabetes in developing countries. Further, even studies on \acp{HIC} did not provide much information regarding the heterogeneity of effects across different socioeconomic subgroups. There was no evidence on how diabetes may affect those in the formal compared to the informal labour market or across the wealth distribution. Further, it was unclear what the effects were for people unaware of their disease.

This study will use cross-sectional data from a large household survey in Mexico, assessing the impact of diabetes on employment probabilities. An \ac{IV} strategy inspired by preceding studies from \acp{HIC} is used to account for the potential endogeneity of diabetes due to unobserved heterogeneity. Especially personal characteristics such as ambition and family background could affect both the probability to develop diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes, and the probability of being employed. The aim is to investigate if diabetes has a causal effect on employment probabilities and to provide evidence for the subgroup of those in the informal labour market and the relatively poor, populations of particular relevance in \acp{MIC}.

\chapter{\label{cha:Mex2}The impact of diabetes on labour market outcomes in Mexico: a panel data and biomarker analysis}
\section*{Pre-amble}

This study builds on the results of the preceding chapter. Instead of using an \ac{IV} approach to address the issue of endogeneity, it takes advantage of the recently released third wave of the \ac{MxFLS} to allow the construction of a longitudinal data set containing three waves. This enables the use of panel data methods to arrive at a potentially causal interpretation of the estimates, without having to rely on an \ac{IV} approach.

Further, the study provides additional evidence for the effect of self-reported diabetes on wages and working hours in a developing country. Finally, it addresses another area identified by the systematic review in Chapter \ref{cha:review}. Using biomarker data it investigates in how diabetes effects the labour market outcomes of the large undiagnosed population, also providing information about whether findings based on self-reported diabetes can be used to infer on the entire diabetes population. This should help to better interpret estimates using self-reported diabetes as provided in Chapter \ref{cha:Mex1}.

\chapter{\label{cha:China} The relationship between diabetes, employment status and behavioural risk factors: An application of marginal structural models and fixed effects to Chinese panel data}
\section*{Pre-amble}

Chapters \ref{cha:Mex1} and \ref{cha:Mex2} provided evidence of the adverse impact of self-reported diabetes on employment probabilities in Mexico. However, if this is also the case in other \acp{MIC} is unclear. Chapter \ref{cha:China} intents to add to this using panel data covering a period of rapid economic transition in China, again estimating the relationship of diabetes and employment status. Moreover, it provides information about the ability of people with diabetes achieving changes in behavioural risk factors important for the prevention of diabetes complications, as studies have shown that smoking cessation and weight loss after a diagnosis can have beneficial effects on blood glucose control and the risk of complications. Importantly, it not only addresses time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity by using individual level fixed effects as in the previous chapter, but also accounts for the potential effects of time-variant confounding by using marginal structural models.

This method is widely applied in epidemiology and able to account for confounding over time, where prior outcomes can affect the current treatment, for example the previous employment status affects the current diabetes status. This potential source of bias has been assumed to not exist in previous studies, but could potentially have biased the estimate of the effect of diabetes on labour market outcomes. This chapter thereby makes several contributions compared to the previous chapters: It provides information about the robustness of the identified relationship of diabetes on employment status by using an alternative estimation strategy in a different setting, thereby also taking into account the potential effect of behavioural risk factors, and it gives first evidence in how far people with diabetes in China are able to change their behavioural risk factors after a diabetes diagnosis.
