\chapter{\label{cha:review}The Economic Costs of Type 2 Diabetes: A Global Systematic Review}
\include{Chapter2}
\chapter{\label{cha:Mex1}The Impact of Diabetes on Employment in Mexico}
\section*{Pre-amble}

The systematic review in Chapter \ref{cha:review} found a paucity of studies on the labour market impact of diabetes in non-\acp{HIC}. Further, even studies on \acp{HIC} did not provide much information regarding the heterogeneity of effects accross different socioeconomic subgroups. There was no evidence on how diabetes may affect those in the formal compared to the informal labour market or across the wealth distribution. Further, it was unclear what the effects were for people unaware of their disease. Chapters \ref{cha:Mex1} and \ref{cha:Mex2} therefore investigate the labour market impact of diabetes in a more comprehensive way than previous literature.

This study will use cross-sectional data from a large household survey in Mexico, assessing the impact of diabetes on employment probabilities. An \ac{IV} strategy inspired by preceding studies from \acp{HIC} is used to account for the potential endogeneity of diabetes due to unobserved heterogeneity. Especially personal characteristics such as ambition and family background could affect both the probability to develop diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes, and the probability to be employed. The aim is to investigate if diabetes has a causal effect on employment probabilities and to provide evidence for the subgroup of those in the informal labour market and the relatively poor, populations of particular relevance in \acp{MIC}.

\chapter{\label{cha:Mex2}The Impact of Diabetes on Labour Market Outcomes in Mexico: a Panel Data and Biomarker Analysis}
\section*{Pre-amble}

This study builds on the results of the preceding chapter. Instead of using an \ac{IV} approach to address the issue of endogeneity, it takes advantage of the recently released third wave of the \ac{MxFLS} to allow the construction of a longitudinal data set containing three waves. This enables the use of panel data methods to arrive at a causal interpretation of the estimates, without having to rely on the untestable assumptions underlying the \ac{IV} approach.

Further, the study provides additional novel evidence for the effect of self-reported diabetes on wages and working hours in a developing country. Finally it addresses another area that hitherto received little research but is of great importance, identified by the systematic review in Chapter \ref{cha:review}. Using biomarker data it investigates in how far self-reported diabetes identifies the entire diabetes population and if findings based on self-reports can be extended to those unaware of the condition. This should help to better interpret estimates using self-reported diabetes as in Chapter \ref{cha:Mex1}.

\chapter{\label{cha:China}The effects of receiving a diabetes diagnosis on health behaviour and economic outcomes in China}
\section*{Pre-amble}

Chapters \ref{cha:Mex1} and \ref{cha:Mex2} provided evidence of the adverse impact of self-reported diabetes on employment probabilities in Mexico. However, if this is also the case in other \acp{MIC} is unclear. The study in Chapter \ref{cha:China} intents to provide further evidence using rich panel data covering a period of rapid economic transition in China. It further intents to provide information about the current success of the Chinese healthcare system in bringing about behaviour change in those diagnosed. Studies have shown that smoking cessation and weight loss after a diagnosis can have beneficial effects on blood glucose control and the risk of complications.

This study again faces the problem of the potential endogeneity of diabetes. It uses an already established approach with the \ac{FE} estimator. However, it adds a further identification strategy by making use of \acp{MSM}, a strategy widely applied in epidemiology to account for time-variant confounding, in particular selection into treatment on pre-treatment outcome variables. It is less known in economics but nicely complements the \ac{FE} method. The aim of the study was to provide information on the success of current diabetes management in the Chinese halthcare system and to identify areas where improvements are needed to curb the burden of diabetes.
